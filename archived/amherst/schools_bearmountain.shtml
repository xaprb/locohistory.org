			  <p><strong><a href="schools.shtml">Three Schools Project in Amherst County</a><br />
	        Bear Mountain Indian Mission School, Kenmore Road (Amherst County) </strong></p>
			  <p>The Bear Mountain Indian Mission School began when missionaries started teaching children of Monacan Indian families during the 1870's in a log cabin on Bear Mountain, Kenmore Road in Amherst, Virginia. The school taught the Indian children of Monacan Indian families. The teachers were white missionaries.</p>
			  <p>In 1908, <img src="ThreeSchools/BearMtSch.jpg" />Reverend Arthur Gray of the Episcopal Diocese of Southwestern Virginia established an Episcopal Church presence on Bear Mountain. A local resident Mr. J.J. Ambler bought a quarter acre next to the log cabin. The Diocese built the first St. Paul's Chapel on a rock next to the log cabin school, as well as adding schoolrooms to the original log cabin.&nbsp; The Diocese bought the land where the school stood, and also took over the operation of the school. Mission workers came to Bear Mountain to live and work, including teaching children. In about 1916 Sweet Briar College built a mission house for deaconesses at the mission.</p>
			  <p>In the 1920s, Dr. Walter Plecker ran the Bureau of Vital Statistics in Virginia. In 1925 Dr. Plecker began a campaign stating that there were no &quot;pure&quot; Indians remaining in Virginia and that all of those claiming to be Indians were &quot;mixed blood Negroes.&quot; Dr. Plecker established a list of names he considered to be names of &quot;mixed&quot; families. Families with these names forbidden to attend white schools, among other things.&nbsp; In the 1930 census, Dr. Plecker insisted that all Indian people in Amherst be listed as &quot;colored.&quot; Letters were sent to Washington by the Monacans and others, protesting this classification and insisting on the existence of Indian tribes in Virginia.&nbsp; At this time there were 54 students at the Bear Mountain Mission School.&nbsp; </p>
			  <p>By the 1940s orchard owners <img src="ThreeSchools/BearMt_Bridge.jpg" />were providing transportation for the children of Indian orchard employees to attend Bear Mountain Indian Mission School.&nbsp; By 1946, the Amherst County School System was sending white teachers to work (or to instruct) at the Mission School, which taught students from the first to the seventh grade.&nbsp; Monacan parents wanting high school education for their children were forced to send students graduating from seventh grade to live with relatives in other states or to move their entire family out of Virginia. </p>
			  <p>In 1956, mission worker and teacher Florence Cowan began campaigning for the Monacan children to be able to attend white schools.&nbsp; According to Karenne Wood and Diane Shields in their book, <em>The Monacan Indians, Our Story, </em>&quot;Although Amherst County listed the Bear Mountain school among its 'white schools,' it did not permit the Monacan children to attend its 'white high schools.'&quot; The Bear Mountain School ended at seventh grade, although another worker, Miss Groff, arranged for eighth grade correspondence courses. Finally in 1963, with Episcopal Church backing for Miss Cowan and the Indian families in their push for integration, 23 students were placed in Amherst County High School. Bear Mountain Indian Mission School closed as a school in 1963.<img src="ThreeSchools/BearMt_books.jpg" /></p>
			  <p>In 1989 the Monacan Indian Nation was formally recognized by the Commonwealth of Virginia as one of eight indigenous tribes of Virginia.&nbsp; The log cabin school building has now been historically restored as part of the Monacan Indian Ancestral Museum with partial funding from the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities. It has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and still stands on Kenmore Road in Amherst. </p>
