			  <p><strong>Three Schools Project in Amherst County: Amherst County Training School </strong></p>
			  <p>Amherst Training School, originally called the Amherst Negro School, was built as a six- classroom wooden frame structure on School Street in Amherst, Virginia, in 1921, with contributions from businesses and local families in the Black community. Additional classrooms and two additional buildings, one a kitchen and lunchroom, the second a classroom brick structure, were added over the years.</p>
			  <p>An October, 1941, Engineers' Report (submitted to the School Board of Amherst County by W.D. Campbell and Sons, Inc.) features <img src="ThreeSchools/TrainingSch.jpg" />a photo of the school with the following description: &quot;Amherst Negro School, Amherst, Virginia. A one story and part basement, frame building with composition shingle roof and wood floors. Wood sealed finish, electric lighting, stove heat.&nbsp; Approximately 19 years old, in fair condition. Occupancy – six class rooms and kitchen.&quot;</p>
			  <p>Elementary Students who attended the Training School lived primarily within the Town of Amherst.&nbsp; Black students from one- and two-room elementary schools in the northern half of Amherst County also fed into Amherst Training School for high school. Like other Amherst County public schools at the time, the Training School had no kindergarten and no 12th grade.&nbsp; The Southern end of the County did not have a Black high school until the Madison Heights School, serving grades one through eleven, opened in 1939. <img src="ThreeSchools/ACTS_Class1949.jpg" /></p>
			  <p>Central High School, opened in 1956. It served all Black public high school students in Amherst County.&nbsp; Amherst Training School continued to serve elementary students until Central Elementary School opened as an all-Black consolidated Amherst County elementary School in 1964.&nbsp; Although Black students began being integrated into Amherst County High School on a very limited basis in 1963, true integration, court ordered and enforced, did not come to Amherst County High School until 1969-70.</p>
