			  <p><strong><a href="schools.shtml">Three Schools Project in Amherst County</a><br />
		      Clifford School, Fletcher's Level Road, Clifford, Amherst County </strong></p>
			  <p>The public school system in Amherst County, Virginia, was set up in the late 19th century.&nbsp; <img src="ThreeSchools/CliffordSch.jpg" />The Clifford School was built at that time as a frame building replacing a previous private school, and had a similar style and shape to other schools being built then in the County.&nbsp; It was a T-shaped building housing three classrooms for grades one through six.&nbsp; The school served the white children of Greater Clifford.  &nbsp;School teachers were housed at 121 Turkey Mountain Road, once the Blacksmith's House.&nbsp; This school had outdoor toilets and was heated by wood stoves. </p>
			  <p>The &quot;new&quot; Clifford School opened in 1939.<img src="ThreeSchools/Clifford_NewSchool.jpg" /> It had four classrooms and a kitchen.&nbsp; The principalâ€™s office was in one of the classrooms. This was an &quot;improved&quot; building with electricity, central heating, radiators, and bathrooms. The Clifford School continued to serve white children, grades one to seven, from the greater Clifford area until full integration and consolidation of the elementary school system took place. This was court ordered and enforced in Amherst County between 1969-70.</p>
