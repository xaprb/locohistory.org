<p>Amherst's rich history is not dead and buried. Rather, it lives on in homes, statues, street names, historic neighborhoods, interpretive trails, and countless other monuments (large and small) that preserve the material culture of the past. The first &quot;virtual visit&quot; is to the Sweet Briar College campus where Daisy Williams' legacy still haunts (literally and figuratively) the college. </p>
