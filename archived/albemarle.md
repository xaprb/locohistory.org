<p>This digital history website was created by <a href="http://www.lynnrainville.org">Dr. Lynn Rainville</a> to share information about Albemarle   County History (including the City of Charlottesville, Virginia). Human history   in the area begins 1000s of years ago with Native American villages. This blog   focuses on the past 300 years of history in the region, ca. 1700-2000 CE. Most   importantly it&rsquo;s about getting out and exploring community histories and sharing   local knowledge. Please contribute historical tidbits that pertain to Albemarle   County. </p>
