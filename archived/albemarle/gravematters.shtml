                <p>Lambs are popular symbols, especially on children's graves. Usually lambs are placed at the top of a stone, and occasionally are carved in 3-D. This lamb is more charismatic than most, with its two legs hanging off the oval within the headstone and partially sitting on a daisy. The deceased was an infant who lived less than 2 months. </p>

                <p>Contemporary cemetery management companies encourage patrons to select markers that are flush with the ground. This allows for easy mowing and &quot;perpetual care.&quot; Many 21st century cemeteries outlaw 3-d markers all together. This week's marker is metal set into concrete and features  a simple cross. The flower is not part of the design, but rather placed there by a mourner.</p>

			    <p>The cemetery landscape includes many features, not just markers. In this photo a recent burial is adorned with beautiful flowers. In the 19th century is was more common to bring the flowers to the home of the deceased to fill the parlor (where the body was laid out). This served a symbolic function and a practical one (helping to mask the smell of the decaying body indoors during the wake). </p>

                <p>Crosses are a very common motif, but usually they are carved into a larger stone. In this case, the stone is shaped as a cross, with the birth and death dates running vertically along the base of the cross. Most likely this stone fell backwards, to come to lie flat in the grass. It dates to the 1960s and is made of marble. The remains of a plant lie to the right.</p>

                <p>This week's stone comes from an African-American cemetery in NW Albemarle County. While the cross is a standard motif, the lily laid at its base is more unusual (and beautiful). Lilies are associated with mourning, innocence, and purity. There is also a rose, associated with rebirth, beauty, and love. Behind the cross is a symbol of a rising sun (and rebirth) and/or the rays of sunlight, associated with the presence of God. The deceased died in 1972 at age 48.</p>

                <p>Most gravestone inscriptions are taken from the Bible or popular poetry. Less than 5% of American stones contain unusual or unique epitaphs. The one on this 1926 stone is not be unique, but it is rare and beautiful: &quot;She faltered by the wayside and the angels took her home.&quot; The carved roses are also unusual in their design (compare them to more standard shapes in the stones featured in earlier posts). Note, I cropped the photo so the morphology and motif would be clearer at this small size, the inscription lies just below the cropped area.</p>

                <p>During this season you will often see halloween decorations which read &quot;R.I.P.&quot; Any school child could tell you that it stands for &quot;rest in peace.&quot; However, a closer look at real cemeteries would reveal that the acronym is hardly ever used on a gravestone. The inscription becomes popular in the 20th century as mourners distance themselves from the pain of &quot;death&quot; by using euphemisms, like &quot;resting.&quot; This week's stone makes a more active statement, proclaiming that the deceased &quot;entered eternal rest.&quot; </p>

                <p>Gravestones have always revealed changes in technologies. In the late 19th century granite became more accessible as cutting tools improved (granite is a much harder stone than the earlier marble or slate). In today's rapidly changing world the biggest impact on stones has been the transfer of photographs and other high resolution images directly to the stone. This polished granite stone depicts a complex hunting scene (complete with dogs, pheasants, hunters, and woods). A scene too complicated to carve by hand except at great expense. </p>

                <p>Earlier gravestones have featured icons that represent personal hobbies. While this fish might very well indicate that the deceased was a fisherman, the choice of a fish on a gravestone has many additional meanings. In Christian theology a motif for the Greek word for fish, &quot;Ichthys,&quot; is used as a symbol for Christian beliefs (commonly seen today on car bumper stickers). Ichthys is meaningful because each of the letters stands for other Greek words which spell out: &quot;Jesus Christ, God's son, savior.&quot; The Bible also references several &quot;fish stories.&quot; </p>

                <p>If you look at last week's gravestone you will see that it is only the left-hand side of a granite memorial. This week's selection is the right-hand side, where the wife/mother lies buried. While her husband had a lily, heart, and praying hands, her side contains a cross within a heart and a rose: complementary opposites. Her name is inscribed within a rather unusual scroll, with notches at either end. </p>

			    <p class="entry">This week's motif is hard to visualize without seeing the entire stone so I'll put it up piecemeal. This is the left hand side of the granite marker, with a beautiful bird. The motif ties into the theme on the other site, two entwined birds which represent the eternal love of the husband and wife buried here. In addition to the bird motif there are praying hands, a heart, a lily (which is repeated on the footstone), and a banner with a quote from the Bible. </p>

                <p>When I first saw this stone, I didn't notice the unique addition. Instead I saw the standard flower, ivy, and scroll pattern (accompanied by the family name, not visible, but to the right of this photo). But when I looked closer I noticed the butterfly sucking nectar from the flower. A wonderful, personalized touch!</p>

The inscription is surrounded by an oval border. This granite stone dates to 1993 and is located in a church cemetery in Albemarle County. </p>

                <p>This gravestone combines multiple motifs. First there is the dove, which symbolizes peace or love. They can also be seen as messengers. In this case, the dove carries a ring with a ribbon laced through it. More commonly doves carry an olive branch, symbolizing peace. But here the ring suggests marriage. On the edges of the stone are roses, pieces of ivy, and columns of light. Note the nickname &quot;Pappy.&quot; </p>

                <p>Flowers are a common motif on gravestones because they symbolize life, beauty, and sometimes, innocence. Conversely, since most flowers have a short life span they can symbolize fragility and impermanence. This week's pink granite gravestone features two carved petals. You can also interpret flowers as a grave offering, in other words an eternal gift of flowers to commemorate the dead. </p>

                <p>This motif combines &quot;praying hands&quot; with a branch from a rose bush. This rose is elaborately carved, with numerous leaves (although no thorns are visible). Serendipitously (or perhaps intentionally), a real live rose bush can be seen growing just behind the granite marker. Flowers are a symbol of rebirth and regeneration.</p>

                <p>Today's gravestone illustrates a motif and a morphology: the former is a lily, the latter is an ornate cross. If you look closer you will also see a fern leaf. The floral motifs correspond to ideas of rebirth and regeneration. The stone commemorates the life of a woman who died in 1901. Romantic styled stones like this one were popular at the turn of the last century and flowers were often associated with women. </p>

                <p>Sometimes the most difficult thing to decipher is the inscription. The best light source for reading obscure letters is the sun itself. This week's soapstone gravestone dates to 1825. The inscription was very faded. In the photo a mirror is used to reflect sunlight directly onto the surface. Under these conditions the names &quot;Baz.&quot; with a suprascript &quot;L&quot; is visible. The stone lies in a small family cemetery and marks the resting place of Bezaleel Brown. </p>

This week's motif combines praying hands with rays of light emerging from the clouds of heaven. The motif is interesting because it only takes a handful of drawn curves to evoke the idea of &quot;heaven.&quot; As noted before, the hands are clearly male (it is very rare to see female hands).

                <p>It is very rare to see a carved &quot;Christ&quot; on a gravestone. Although inscriptions often reference &quot;asleep in Jesus,&quot; or &quot;God,&quot; it is unusual to see a figural representation of either (except with the &quot;shaking hands&quot; motif discussed in past weeks). This gravestone depicts Christ on the cross, with a banner above his head. Although blank on the stone, if they had had space I assume they would have carved &quot;I.N.R.I.&quot; The acronym stands for &quot;Iesvs Nazarenvs Rex Iudaeorvm&quot; and translates to &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&quot;</p>

			    <p>Humans are not the only ones who receive memorials at death. Many owners commemorate their pet's death in some fashion. This week's photo is a series of pet graves, located on the lawn of a house in Charlottesville. These granite markers are miniature versions of a person's tombstone. Notice the ivy growing in the background, the same groundcover that is found in graveyards. In Beloved Memory, Carbon, (11/11/1997 - 1/17/2009). <img src="Graves/Carbon.jpg" width="81" height="121" /></p>

                <p>This blog usually focuses on gravestones, but above-ground grave offerings are just as interesting. This stone is located in a family cemetery. The stone is typical for the early 20th century, a curved marble stone, with no imagery. The funerary statues are more unusual: two squirrels and a small rabbit (in the middle of the photo). The top squirrel is hoarding nuts while the lower one watches for his/her opportunity to &quot;borrow&quot; a pawful. </p>

                <p>In 2008, every gravestone featured in this blog was located in either Albemarle, Nelson, or Amherst County Virginia. But occasionally I get a submission from further afield. To illustrate other regional styles, I decided to post a non-local stone every once in a while. This week's stone comes from Abingdon. The epitaph on the forward-most stone reads: <br />
                  <em>Of This vain world I only took a peep<br />
                Disliked it closed my eyes and fell asleep.</em></p>

                <p>This mini-blog focuses on gravestones. But there are other features to notice within historic cemeteries. One important attribute is the plantings within a cemetery. In this week's photo a large yucca plant is planted in lieu of a gravestone. The pink heart-shaped wreath was brought by a mourner. So even though the identity of the deceased is obscure for the public, the deceased's kin keep track of who is buried under this bush. </p>

			    <p>Floral motifs are very popular because they symbolize rebirth and growth. Often flowers are associated with women or children, to emphasize their supposed beauty and innocence. In this case there are two different floral elements: a rosette design in the center and more abstract leaves, possibly ivy, at the edges. The stone commemorates the life of a woman who died in the early 20th Century. There is an extra flourish in the design, three vertical tick marks. The end result is an elegant carving.</p>

                <p>This week's gravestone is more of a hypothetical post. What if we used Halloween imagery on gravestones ? I find it counterintuitive that despite the association between death and Halloween in this country, that symbolism does not carry over onto our gravestones. This is in contrast to other mortuary celebrations (such as the Days of the Dead in Mexico) where there is an association between cultural practices (remembering the dead by picnicking in cemeteries) and mortuary rituals. I have yet to see a Halloween-inspired motif on a gravestone (no black cats, ghosts, jack-o-lanterns, or witches). But do drop me an email if you find one on your travels. In the meantime, Happy Halloween!</p>

In this late 20th-century, granite stone, the decedent (or their surviving family members) selected images that represent interests or hobbies.

The standard, upright version is made of marble, 42 inches long, 13 inches wide and 4 inches thick, weighing about 230 pounds.

Today, urns are less common, but flower vases of all shapes and sizes are very popular.

                <p>This gravestone was erected by the &quot;Virginia Conservation Commission&quot; in 1948, decades after the deceased's death. While not very common, in this case an historic committee decided to sponsor a gravestone. The marker commemorates  Shelton F. Leake, Sr. (1812-1884), a former lieutenant-governor of Virginia (1852-56). Leake was also a member of Congress and a criminal lawyer. It is not clear why the stone was erected, perhaps the original one was damaged or in poor condition. The stone lies in the Maplewood Cemetery. </p>

Bell Funeral Home and the Charlottesville African-American Genealogy Group collaborated to compile death certificate records. The late Julian Burke and other members labored to collect the information and enter it into a computer spreadsheet. Mr John F. Bell owned the Funeral Home in 1917. It continues today as the oldest family run funeral home in Central Virginia and the area's oldest existing business owned by people of color.

                <p>This week's photo reminds us of the distinction between headstones and footstones. A stone that lacks any data other than initials is, most likely, a footstone. A second clue is the small size of this stone, relative to the headstone. So here we see a footstone for an individual with the initials &quot;M.M.B.&quot; It's useful to differentiate footstones from headstones so you don't overcount the number of individuals within a cemetery (i.e., double count one burial twice, based on the number of stones). This stone is a somewhat unusual material, pink granite and lies in the Maplewood Cemetery. </p>

                <p>Most of the gravestones discussed here have inscriptions. But it is just as important, and culturally significant, to recognize uninscribed stones, such as this week's gravestone. This stone lies within a small family cemetery in Amherst County. While it is impossible to date precisely, it probably dates to the late 19th or early 20th Century. This style was once very common among poor families (or for children who died in infancy). Families with unmarked graves may want to map and label these memorials on paper so that future generations will know who is buried where. </p>

                <p>Studying the motifs on gravestones conveys information about family relationships, biographies, accomplishments, and ideas about death and religion. But none of this is possible if the stone does not survive. The marble gravestone has been broken off along its base and now lies facing towards the elements (a guaranteed way to erode inscriptions). The stone reads &quot;At Rest,&quot; but those words will soon fade and eventually the entire text will become illegible. Unfortunately it requires some background in grave maintenance to conduct repairs that don't damage the stone further.

This stone is the earliest dated memorial within the Daughters of Zion Cemetery (an African-American Cemetery located just north of Oakwood). This cemetery was founded by a woman's charitable group. The early historic documentation is spotty, but this stone, dated 1873, proves that the cemtery was in use by that date.

                <p>Sometimes the morphology and placement of the stones is just as telling as the iconography. In this example, a husband and wife lie buried adjacent to each other. Even though they died a decade and a half apart, their stones share many similarities (raw material, shape, style, size, etc.). Many married couples purchase two stones upon the first death, to ensure continuity. Other couples share a stone to achieve identical commemorations. In this simple example, the couple includes their birth and death dates (no age) and simply list that they &quot;died in New Orleans&quot; (leaving a mystery as to how and why their remains were returned to Charlottesville for burial).</p>

                <p>The data that is included on gravestones changes over time (literally). In the early 19th Century it was popular to include highly descriptive inscriptions concerning the time and place of death. In this 1804 gravestone, the deceased is listed as having &quot;departed this life the 19th Decr, 1804, at 4 O clock P.M. aged eight months. Sometimes stones are even more precise, providing minutes and seconds. </p>

                <p>This gravestone combines two popular 19th/20th Century motifs: the crown and the cross. The cross is  a symbol of the Christian faith and illustrates a hope for resurrection and salvation. The crown is a symbol of glory after death and/or triumph over death. The design of the cross is fairly standard, but the crowns vary from British-inspired regalia to the almost jester-like design of the crown seen in this photo. </p>

                <p>One of my all time favorite motifs, the finger pointing down. As discussed 2 weeks ago, the upward pointing finger is an optimistic reference to the deceased ascending the heaven. This one.....is either more pessimistic or, more likely, a symbolic reference to the location of the deceased's place of eternal rest. The stone can be found in the UVA Cemetery in the confederate section and marks the grave of Leonard, the son of &quot;Hore &amp; Hannah.&quot; The stone is hard to read, Hore may be for Horace. It actually looks like Hope, but I doubt a mid-19th Century commemorates two mothers. </p>

                <p>This gravestone  is located in the Maplewood cemetery. The carving is of a 3-dimensional tree trunk, symbolizing an interrupted life (i.e., just the trunk, not the complete tree). Sometimes the number of broken branches correlates with the number of deceased family members buried at the site. But this trunk has more broken limbs than burials. </p>
			<p>Often cut tree trunks or broken columns indicate a life that was cut short. </p>

                <p> This is one of my favorite gravestone icons: the finger pointing to heaven. One assumes that it represents an ascent to heaven. Which leads one to wonder whether anyone is ever buried under a finger pointing down. </p>

                <p>This grave may be hard to read on the screen, but its epitaph is very poignant. The gravestone lies within a small family plot on a nearby plantation. Its morphology is a simple curved marble stone, with the deceased's name, birth and death dates: 1861 to 1880. The inscription is typical of late Victorian melodrama, coupled with a family poet. The inscription reads: &quot;<em>Our treasure is in heaven / the gift in the strong hand/ of the great Giver.....Our hearts grow very lonely/ When we think of him as dead/ Absent from our home forever/ Sleeping in his silent bed/ We know that he is happy/ dwelling where the angels dwell/ and our crushed hearts murmer softly: / Jesus doeth all things well</em>.&quot; </p>

               <p>The Lamb is a classic symbol of innocence and youth. They are usually reserved for a child's grave. The stone above is a rare exception. The deceased was 61 years old. In this case, rather than innocence, the lamb may refer to a Christian belief in purity and a metaphor for the &quot;lamb of God.&quot; </p>

                <p>Some motifs highlight a person's hobbies or social affiliations. The motif above is the classic Masonic symbol, indicating membership in the Freemasonry Society. This all-male group is veiled in secrecy, using esoteric symbols to communicate their  belief in a Supreme Being. The image above is one of their iconic symbols, the compass, surveyor's t-square, and the letter &quot;G&quot; which is often interpreted as an acronym for &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Geometry.&quot; </p>

               <p>This week's gravestone doesn't have a fancy motif, instead it's just letters. But I include it so that you can recognize footstones as opposed to headstones or family memorials. In the photo at the right, the large memorial topped by an urn is the family marker. The footstone lies about 6 feet away, and is a much smaller, curved stone. The complete name of the deceased can be found on the memorial, while the footstone only contains the initials, &quot;R.S&quot; and the abbreviation for &quot;junior.&quot; Large family markers, surrounded by smaller footstones are popular in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. </p>

                <p>Similar in spirit to the last two posts, this 19th Century gravestone (in Oakwood) illustrates a highly sentimentalized attitude towards death and loss. Although somewhat eroded, the stone includes a bust of a young boy, surrounded by a laurel wreath. The laurel wreath was worn by ancient Romans after victory in battle. Here it is probably meant metaphorically, as a testament to victory over death or immortality. </p>

               <p>I promise, I will have images other than mourners, but I couldn't resist a second stone with the same theme: the importance of mourning the deceased. Here, a wife holds a handkerchief to her head, while weeping at the pedestal of her husband's grave (decorated with an urn). Her two children stand behind her, holding hands. A weeping willow stands in the background and the inscription reads &quot;scared to the memory of.&quot; The stone is in the Maplewood cemetery. </p>
