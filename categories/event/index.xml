      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does an obelisk symbolize? Who is a &amp;ldquo;relict&amp;rdquo;? How do you figure out which stones are &amp;ldquo;headstones&amp;rdquo; and which are &amp;ldquo;footstones&amp;rdquo; associated with family monuments? To answer these questions, Dr. Lynn Rainville is offering a new course on &amp;ldquo;Death and Dying in Albemarle County&amp;rdquo; this Fall (2012) through UVA&amp;rsquo;s School of Continuing and Professional Studies. The class will meet Thursday nights from October 25 through December 13 (no class on November 22), from 7pm to 9pm at Darden (classroom TBA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DeathDying.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief description of the class: This course surveys 300 years of local mortuary practices, from Native American burial mounds to modern memorial parks. This overview includes a study of gravestone iconography, changing mortuary rituals, and cemetery landscapes.  The goal will be to reconstruct the lives of the dead as well as the beliefs of those that buried them. Visits to nearby graveyards will supplement in-class lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more or register, please visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scps.virginia.edu/programs/personal-enrichment-classes-fall2012&#34;&gt;SCPS Fall Course List&lt;/a&gt; (with lots of great classes).

      <title>Recognizing Veterans on Memorial Day</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2012/05/27/recognizing-veterans-on-memorial-day/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 May 2012 21:49:32 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2012/05/27/recognizing-veterans-on-memorial-day/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Memorial Day&amp;rdquo; has become a gateway to summer: public pools and beaches open for the season, grills are fired up, and public offices are closed. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget the reason for the holiday. Originally called Decoration Day (in recognition of the efforts to bring flowers and flags to the graveside of fallen soldiers), its origins are debated. Some credit southern women for starting the tradition of decorating veteran graves after the Civil War, but the official origins lie with General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, who established the first Memorial Day via a General Order on May 5, 1868.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/memday_flags.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that month, on May 30, flowers were placed on the graves of both Confederate and Union soldiers in Arlington National Cemetery. The holiday was first recognized by a state, New York, in 1873 and by the rest of the northern states by 1890. The south recognized their dead on separate dates until after World War I when the scope of the holiday was broadened to remember the sacrifice of all American soldiers who died in any war (as opposed to the earlier focus on the Civil War dead).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2000, a federal resolution was passed to create a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://clinton4.nara.gov/remembrance/&#34;&gt;National Moment of Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; encouraging Americans to pause at 3pm on Memorial Day and remember the ultimate sacrifice given by so many of our men and women in uniform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year (28 May 2012) Memorial Day observances coincidence with the first annual Virginia Festival of History, celebrating the 250th anniversary of Charlottesville&amp;rsquo;s founding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/memday_homefront1967.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days events are organized around the theme &amp;ldquo;250 Years of Service in our Nation&amp;rsquo;s Wars.&amp;rdquo; The celebrations begin at 11am at the Albemarle County Office Building; followed by a lecture on Sheridan&amp;rsquo;s James River Campaign of 1865 (by Richard L. Nicholas, Grace Covenant Church, 1:30pm); a film showing and discussion of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.dailyprogress.com/lifestyles/cdp-lifestyles/2008/mar/30/home_film_is_reminder_of_old_days-ar-86095/&#34;&gt;Homefront 1967&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;ldquo;  about Charlottesville during the Vietnam War by Art Beltone (also at the Grace Church, 3:30pm); a tour of the Maplewood Cemetery (by Steven G. Meeks, meeting at the cemetery, 5:30pm); and a lecture on Medal of Honor recipients from Charlottesville and Albemarle (at the Grace Church, 7pm). For directions to the Grace Covenant Church, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gracecov.com/contact.html&#34;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the weekend, the American Legion will hand out poppies as a symbolic reminder of fallen soldiers. And in Ruckersville, you can visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vietnamwarfoundation.org/&#34;&gt;Vietnam War Foundation and Museum&lt;/a&gt; on Monday (usually it&amp;rsquo;s only open by appointment).&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vietnamwarfoundation.org/&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/memday_poppies1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tradition of wearing poppies originated with &amp;ldquo;We Shall Keep the Faith,&amp;rdquo; a poem written by Moina Michael (1869-1944) in response to another famous poem &amp;ldquo;In Flanders Fields.&amp;rdquo; Describing the battlefield of Belgium, McCrae&amp;rsquo;s 1915 poem began &amp;ldquo;In Flanders fields the poppies blow / Between the crosses, row on row&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Building on this theme, the second stanza in Michael&amp;rsquo;s poem read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cherish too, the Poppy red
That grows on fields where valor led,
It seems to signal to the skies
That blood of heroes never dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/memday_poppy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After World War I ended, Ms. Michael began selling silk poppies to raise money for disabled veterans. The American Legion Auxiliary adopted the poppy as an official symbol of remembrance for war veterans in 1921. Other WWI allies adopted the striking red poppy and today it is used in Memorial Day celebrations as a symbolic reminder of the lives lost.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Attend a free lecture on local African-American Cemeteries by Dr. Lynn Rainville at the Jefferson-Madison Regional Library Sunday, February 5th at 2pm in the McIntire Room (third floor, central branch of the library). Professor Rainville will discuss her research into historic, black burial grounds and the associated mortuary beliefs and funerary patterns. Come learn more about these &amp;ldquo;outdoor museums&amp;rdquo; of African-American beliefs and family connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/cemtalk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the talk, explore a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/&#34;&gt;related website&lt;/a&gt; designed by Prof. Rainville that includes information about dozens of historic, black cemeteries in Albemarle and Amherst Counties. Below is an excerpt from a walking tour of Charlottesville&amp;rsquo;s historic Daughters of Zion Cemetery (located minutes away from the Downtown Mall). Clicking on the image will take you to a virtual tour but please get out to see the real thing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enslaved People at University of Virginia</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2012/01/17/enslaved-people-at-university-of-virginia/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Upcoming event, January 25th, 2012, Noon: “The Enduring Legacy of Henry Martin and Other Enslaved Laborers at  U.Va.” (in the Harrison Institute auditorium).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/henrymartin1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that day, at 5:30 p.m., a second event will be held to honor Mr. Martin as part of U.Va.’s commemoration of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (in the Rotunda Dome Room). Several scholars will discuss the lives and contributions of Mr. Martin and other formerly enslaved people at UVA during the lunchtime lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Martin was born into slavery at Monticello on the day that Thomas Jefferson died: July 4, 1826. He was later sold to the Carr family, but eventually earned his freedom. In 1847 he was hired (as a free man) to be the bell ringer for the University of Virginia. Waking at 4am to begin work and tending to the bells throughout the day, he worked until his retirement in 1909. He died in 1915 at age 89. To read more about his life and the upcoming event, visit an external link to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://uvamagazine.org/only_online/article/in_the_age_of_slavery/&#34;&gt;UVA press release about Henry Martin and the upcoming events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spend this Memorial Day honoring some of Charlottesville&amp;rsquo;s former citizens and learning more about how Charlottesvillians from the past honored the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mpl_1913.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lynnrainville.org/&#34;&gt;Dr. Lynn Rainville&lt;/a&gt; (anthropologist and historian) on a one-hour tour of one of Charlottesville&amp;rsquo;s most historic graveyards, Maplewood Cemetery (&lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=maplewood+cemetery,+charlottesville,+va&amp;amp;aq=&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=72.059064,81.298828&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=maplewood+cemetery,&amp;amp;hnear=Charlottesville,+Virginia&amp;amp;ll=38.033169,-78.473808&amp;amp;spn=0.008797,0.009924&amp;amp;z=17&#34;&gt;located behind Martha Jefferson Hospital&lt;/a&gt;). Learn about historic gravestone symbols, mortuary rituals, and funerals from bygone eras. Find out why Victorian mothers were encouraged to take their children on strolls through the landscapes of the dead. And get a sneak-peak into the lives of 19th-century Charlottesvillians (these individuals will return later this year during the Society&amp;rsquo;s October Spirit Walk). Tickets are $5 a piece and must be reserved in advance. All proceeds go to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.albemarlehistory.org/&#34;&gt;Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society&lt;/a&gt; to support their efforts to preserve and promote local history.

      <title>Veteran Poets: Graffiti &amp; the Vietnam War</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/02/17/veteran-poets-graffiti-the-vietnam-war/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has already been a lot of press and events surrounding the current exhibit at the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society, but if you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet had a chance to visit, do so soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/vietnamgraffitiexhibit.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;vietnamgraffitiexhibit.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of the exhibit is: &lt;em&gt;Marking Time: Voyage to Vietnam&lt;/em&gt;. Guest curator Art Beltrone (a military artifact historian and former marine) began collecting graffiti from the Vietnam War in the late 1990s after assisting with the production of Terrence Malick&amp;rsquo;s film update of &lt;em&gt;The Thin Red Line&lt;/em&gt;. During this project he visited the wreck of the General Nelson M Walker and noticed the graffiti that covered parts of the ship. Art, and his wife Lee, began a  quest to recover and preserve this informal wartime art (created by veterans) and to collect the stories behind the art. A  sample of their 150 canvases is on display at the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society through February. Only one of the canvases mentions Charlottesville, but each canvas provides insight into the concerns of soldiers and aspects of their daily life while serving abroad.  The exhibit features  a cell phone tour that allows you to listen to interviews with veterans. A book and movie also accompany the exhibit. For more information and directions to the Historical Society please visit their &lt;a href=&#34;http://albemarlehistory.org/current_exhibit.htm&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Or read more about the exhibit from local news media coverage, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.c-ville.com/index.php?cat=1990507071411724&amp;amp;ShowArticle_ID=11430601080889207&#34;&gt;C-ville&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailyprogress.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=CDP/MGArticle/CDP_BasicArticle&amp;amp;cid=1173354619907&amp;amp;c=MGArticle&#34;&gt;Daily Progress&lt;/a&gt;. The exhibit is sponsored, in part, by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virginiafoundation.org/&#34;&gt;Virginia Foundation for the Humanities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beyond Jamestown: Virginia Indians Yesterday &amp; Today</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/02/02/beyond-jamestown-virginia-indians-yesterday-today/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Feb 2008 18:20:33 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/02/02/beyond-jamestown-virginia-indians-yesterday-today/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/beyjames_overview.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;beyjames_overview.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vadm.org/&#34;&gt;Virginia Discovery Museum&lt;/a&gt; is hosting the exhibit &amp;ldquo;Beyond Jamestown&amp;rdquo; (curated by Karenne Wood, director of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virginiafoundation.org/VIHP/program.html&#34;&gt;Virginia Indian Heritage Program&lt;/a&gt; at the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities). The exhibit runs through May 11th and is well worth a visit for children of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/beyjames_crops.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;beyjames_crops.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While kids and their adult guests read about the vibrant heritage of Indians in Virginia, children can learn how to plant the &amp;ldquo;three sisters&amp;rdquo; (corns, beans, and squash, a nutritional assemblage that provided essential amino acids) and fish from a traditional dugout canoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/beyjames_fish.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fishing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be hard to see in the photos, but the fish and wooden crops have an ingenious velcro system so that kids can &amp;ldquo;catch&amp;rdquo; the fish in the net and &amp;ldquo;plant&amp;rdquo; the crops by attaching them to painted stalks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/beyjames_hearth.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cooking&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to cook the food before consuming it! A lifesized longhouse or wigwam (from the Woodland period) was constructed so that kids could bring their hunted and gathered (from agricultural fields) meal and sit in front of an educational film about native peoples in Virginia. The large exhibit room also contains a reconstruction of a segregated school house (based on historic photos of the Monacan School in Amherst), activities designed to teach kids (and adults) about the past and present of Virginia Indians, and a series of installations about traditional crafts and technologies. The exhibit contains lots of valuable information about everyday life and traditions. The children I observed had to be pulled away from their fields and canoe when it was time to go. A teacher&amp;rsquo;s guide accompanies the exhibition and highlights correlations between the exhibit themes and the SOLs. With generous sponsorship from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virginiafoundation.org/&#34;&gt;Virginia Foundation for the Humanities&lt;/a&gt; and Rose and Robert Capon, the admission fee is only $4. And don&amp;rsquo;t miss the historic carousel outside the museum. The exhibition was developed by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmnh.net/&#34;&gt;Virginia Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; in Martinsville. P.S. If you&amp;rsquo;re over 4 feet high, but the only thing you were taught about Indians involves &amp;ldquo;massacres,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;princesses and dramatic rescues,&amp;rdquo; or mascots for sports teams, this exhibit is well worth a visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Virginia Indian families at the turn of the last century, visit the 3rd floor of Newcomb Hall (just  east of UVa&amp;rsquo;s Emmett Street parking garage, on UVA grounds) to view a photographic exihibit (or&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.faculty.sbc.edu/lrainville/VAIndiansExhibit/index.html&#34;&gt; click here&lt;/a&gt; for the website).&lt;/p&gt;

The meeting will include the ACHS Annual Report, elections of officers, and an illustrated talk on the tree industry by Tom Dierauf (formerly with the Virginia Department of Forestry). After the talk there will be a chance to tour two lumber companies: Yancey (the origin of the name Yancey Mills) and J.B. Barnes. For more information (and directions), visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.albemarlehistory.org/&#34;&gt;ACHS Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When settlers first arrived in Albemarle they spent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/kinglumberco.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Former King Lumber Warehouse&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a great deal of time clearing the then heavily forested Piedmont. Shortly there after, this lumber was used to build houses and fences. In the early 20th Century, W.W. King built a warehouse for storing timber products, shown here in an old photograph (the warehouse, not Reid&amp;rsquo;s Supermarket). This company went out of business during the depression, but many other industries flourished and continue into the present. Come join us this Sunday to learn more about this historic industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Visit the Albemarle County Historical Society for their newest exhibit titled: **The Story of Albemarleâ€™s Trees and her Forest Industries. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/timberbaskets.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Baskets made from local timber products&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting from the historical society website: &amp;ldquo;Trees were an integral part of early settlersâ€™ lives and work, and they fueled one of Albemarleâ€™s most important industries&amp;ndash;lumber. The story of the trees&amp;ndash;use, overuse, and conservation&amp;ndash;is the story of the growth of the County, both socially and economically.&amp;rdquo; This exhibit contains an array of material culture that pertains to forest products: from split-oak baskets to locally-made oak chairs, from wooden slats to forestry tools, from photographs to advertisements from area timber industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition was curated by Catherine Anne Daley, a University of Virginia summer intern through the Institute for Public History, with assistance from ACHS staff and volunteers. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.albemarlehistory.org/&#34;&gt;Click here to get more information about visiting the exhibition&lt;/a&gt; (on display through Fall 2007).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WWII Exhibit in Scottsville</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://avenue.org/smuseum/home.html&#34;&gt;Scottsville Museum&lt;/a&gt; is a hidden treasure&amp;hellip;.about 20 miles south of C-ville, but worth the trip. They have recently opened a new exhibit, titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://avenue.org/smuseum/exhibits/home.html&#34;&gt;Small Town, Big War&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/wwii_exhibit.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;WWII Exhibit at Scottsville Museum&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have collected dozens of &lt;a href=&#34;http://avenue.org/smuseum/ourhistory/home.html&#34;&gt;oral histories&lt;/a&gt; from Scottsville veterans who served in the war (conveniently transcribed and available in notebooks distributed throughout the exhibit). The photo shown here illustrates a reconstructed tent space of a U.S. Army communicator at a WWII command post. The exhibit is filled with interesting facts (like the microfilming of mail to US soldiers so that they could save valuable space on transport boats and planes, a.k.a. v-mail). Or a reconstructed Scottsville kitchen during WWII and the statistic that &amp;ldquo;victory gardens&amp;rdquo; provided 41% of the vegetables consumed by US citizens during the war (you can imagine what a miniscule amount of food today&amp;rsquo;s home gardens provide vs store-bought food). Pick a beautiful day and enjoy the scenic drive down to this well-designed exhibit. As an aside, this exhibit illustrates the importance of local county (loco) history for understanding larger cultural trends.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the Revolutionary War, the Barracks (located west of the shopping center; today a horse stable) was a prison for British and German troops captured at The Battle of Saratoga in October 1777. &lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/hessian.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A German Hessian Soldier&#34; /&gt;They were originally imprisoned by Revolutionary forces in Massachusetts, but within the year they marched 628 miles to the more hospitable climate of Charlottesville, Virginia. The term &amp;ldquo;hessian&amp;rdquo; is a reference to the German mercenaries who fought for the British. Hence, the nearby housing development on Georgetown Road called &amp;ldquo;Hessian Hills.&amp;rdquo; Although no prisoner list survives, estimates suggest over 4,000 prisoners lived at the Barracks. By the spring of 1779, locals described the camp as a small town with a commissary store, a coffeehouse, and a theater. Despite these amenities, over 1,000 prisoners escaped between 1779 and 1780. Many of the German soldiers settled in the Shenandoah Valley and became American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Barracks Road Shopping Center</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/03/14/barracks-road-shopping-center/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barracksroad.com/ourcommunity.php&#34;&gt;Barracks Road Shopping Center&lt;/a&gt; is one of the oldest in the country, dating to 1959. To view the rest of this great old photograph of Barracks Road, see Cville Dave&amp;rsquo;s Posting on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cvilledave.blogspot.com/2007/01/barracks-road-shopping-center-early.html&#34;&gt;Barracks Road Shopping Center in the 1960s.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/barracks1960s.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Barracks Road, circa 1960s&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the photo you can see the newly built shopping center, mostly surrounded by woods, with large expanses of asphalt for the &amp;ldquo;acres of free parking&amp;rdquo; that was touted in the original advertisement. Built by an area developer, Rinehart, it displaced a famous tavern called Carroll&amp;rsquo;s Tea Room. Moore&amp;rsquo;s history of Charlottesville reports that although it often possessed neither tea nor room, it was &amp;ldquo;an oasis for thousands of thirsty university students.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/barrackslogo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Barracks Road Logo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look closely at the Barracks Road logo, found on signs along the edges of the retail center, you will notice a rider on a horse. This logo references the cavalry soldiers who manned the &amp;ldquo;Barracks.&amp;rdquo; The military barracks were constructed west of town near Ivy Farms during the Revolutionary War to house British and German prisoners-of-war.&lt;/p&gt;
