      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/brand_brand.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A self portrait by Mrs Frances Brand.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past two years a committee has been working on restoring and researching the remarkable collection of 150 works of art painted by Frances Brand (1901-1990), a notable Charlottesville folk artist. She was also known for her work as a civil rights activist and as a world traveler. In the 1950s after serving as a major in the US Army, she retired and began studying painting in Mexico City. The painting shown at the right is a self-portrait. Eventually she chose a theme for her works, people who were pioneers in a given field or endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/brand_unid15.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;An unidentified portrait by Mrs Frances Brand&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She defined these &amp;ldquo;firsts&amp;rdquo; in broad terms, from the first female flag person on a Virginian road crew to the first female African-American police officer in town.  Other &amp;ldquo;firsts&amp;rdquo; were more obscure, such as the first Charlottesville mother to use the Lamaze method. Her work was exhibited many times, most recently at the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.albemarlehistory.org/Brand_Intro.htm&#34;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; for an on-line version of the exhibit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently her grand-daughter, Cynthia Brand, initiated a discussion with the Department of Parks &amp;amp; Recreation Therapeutic Arts program to donate the paintings so that they could be displayed and inspire people of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/brand_unid.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;An unidentified Portrait by Mrs Frances Brand&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several members of the community have joined forces to research and assess the condition of the collection so that it can be preserved for future exhibits. This effort includes private individuals, Cindy Brand, the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society, the City of Charlottesville, the Perry Foundation, and the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation (the last four groups generously donated funds to this project). Efforts are on-going to write the biographies of the people depicted in the paintings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee needs YOUR help in identifying some of the paintings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/brand_unid10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;An unidentified portrait of a Charlottesville â€œfirstâ€ by Frances Brand.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most were labeled with the name of the subject, the selections illustrated here have not been identified. If you have any idea who might be depicted please post a comment below. You will need to study the icons in the paintings to read the storyline that Mrs Brand intended. For example, the painting below is, most likely, the first Chinese (-American ?) accepted to UVA or perhaps the first Asian faculty member. The book he&amp;rsquo;s holding may also be related to his &amp;ldquo;first&amp;rdquo; accomplishment. If anyone can read the inscription that would be a helpful start. The portrait above him might be the first inter-racial couple in Charlottesville and the one above that the first African-American postal carrier in the city. These are just guesses, but hopefully the images will jog someone&amp;rsquo;s memory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Historic Fountains</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/04/07/historic-fountains/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, urban traffic in Charlottesville required something other than a gas station for fuel. Instead, the equine motors needed water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/fountain1892.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;1892 Fountain off the Downtown Mall&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To satisfy this daily requirement, the city installed four water fountains. The upper portion of the fountain was for two-legged animals, while other domesticates used the overflow from the &amp;ldquo;fishes&amp;rdquo; that was collected below in a basin. Unfortunately, none of the fountains survived &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; in the 20th century. But recently the Charlottesville Volunteer Fire Company and the City of Charlottesville restored one of them and erected it near Court Square (seen at the left in the photograph). The fountain dates to 1892, while the design was patented in 1880. The next time you are strolling down the mall, take a short side-trip to view the intricately carved motifs on this historic feature.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Central Place</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/06/11/central-place/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Which C-ville landmark is referred to as &amp;ldquo;central place.&amp;rdquo; Could it be the Courthouse ? UVA ? Main Street ? The correct answer is the fountain located in the middle of the downtown mall. The fountain was designed, in part, to commemorate the wells that once lined Water Street and other downtown roads (see the earlier post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/06/03/water-street-well-wishes/&#34;&gt;Wells along Water Street&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/fountainmall.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Central Place Fountain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed by Lawrence Halprin, the fountain contains 3 concrete structures. They symbolize the three notches carved into trees that originally marked the path of &amp;ldquo;Three Notched (or Chopped) Road&amp;rdquo; (today&amp;rsquo;s Main Street / Route 250). If you look carefully as you stroll along the mall you&amp;rsquo;ll find the historic sign that describes the path of this early road. The fountain was dedicated in 1976, when the mall was re-opened as a pedestrian walkway. Ironically, it was meant to be a gathering place, but a metal chain was later installed to discourage people from going into the fountain. To learn more about the fountain, read The Hook&amp;rsquo;s article titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2007/01/18/ONARCH%200603.rtf.aspx&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fountainblue.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Water Street &amp; Well Wishes</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/06/04/water-street-well-wishes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/wackywell1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A wooden artifact discovered during construction&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction in historic Charlottesville can sometimes net unexpected results. Recently, City workers were digging off the downtown mall and came across an odd piece of wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/wackywell2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Artifact Pieces&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they took the care to stop and remove the artifact in one piece, we get a glimpse into 19thC water technology. The artifact is part of an old well. The wooden piece is the bouyant part within the well (floating in the water). The accompanying metal pieces secure the wood within the well and allow it to open and close the opening to the well. Because we know the provenience of the artifact, the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society was able to research the origins of the well. Below is a map of the find spot, with the well (shown here on a city plan) highlighted in orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/wackywellmap.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Find spot of the well&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the map, you will notice that the well was dug at the corner of Main and Second Street. If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound familiar, try Water Street &amp;amp; 2nd Street (the contemporary street names). This well and many others like it explain the origin for the name &amp;ldquo;Water Street.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hugh Carr and Hiking Trails</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/03/03/hugh-carr-and-hiking-trails/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ivycreekfoundation.org/ICNA.html&#34;&gt;Ivy Creek Natural Area &lt;/a&gt;contains hiking trails, copious amounts of birds, and a learning center. In 1880, on this same site, Hugh Carr&amp;rsquo;s 80-acre farm, River View, contained crops, a milk cow, 4 swine, 10 poultry, and many other agricultural features. Although born into slavery around 1840, Hugh Carr worked hard after emancipation to save his earnings and invest in land in the Hydraulic Mills neighborhood (along the Rivanna). The &lt;a href=&#34;http://ivycreekfoundation.org/home.html&#34;&gt;Ivy Creek Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has conducted extensive research into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ivycreekfoundation.org/FamilyHistory.html&#34;&gt;Life &amp;amp; Legacy of the Carr family&lt;/a&gt;. Many 19th and 20th Century features are visible today: the original farmhouse, a clapboard barn, historic road beds, and springhouses. Make sure you visit the ICNF site before you go so that you can enjoy the rich history of this farm. &lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/carrcem.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Carr Family Cemetery&#34; /&gt;
During your visit, take a few moments to visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virginia.edu/woodson/projects/aacaac/db/cemetery/details/CRR/&#34;&gt;Carr Family Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. It contains an interesting array of granite and carved fieldstone gravemarkers.&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/monticellohotelsherd.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh Carr&amp;rsquo;s son-in-law, Conly Greer, contracted with several area businesses to haul away their trash. Many of these items, referred to by archaeologists as &amp;ldquo;artifacts&amp;rdquo; (it&amp;rsquo;s true, archaeologists study trash), are visible above-ground in trash middens. Below is a sherd with the profile of a famous Charlottesvillian which was the logo for the Old Monticello Hotel (located across from the courthouse).&lt;/p&gt;
