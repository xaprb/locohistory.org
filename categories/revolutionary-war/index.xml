      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the Revolutionary War, the Barracks (located west of the shopping center; today a horse stable) was a prison for British and German troops captured at The Battle of Saratoga in October 1777. &lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/hessian.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A German Hessian Soldier&#34; /&gt;They were originally imprisoned by Revolutionary forces in Massachusetts, but within the year they marched 628 miles to the more hospitable climate of Charlottesville, Virginia. The term &amp;ldquo;hessian&amp;rdquo; is a reference to the German mercenaries who fought for the British. Hence, the nearby housing development on Georgetown Road called &amp;ldquo;Hessian Hills.&amp;rdquo; Although no prisoner list survives, estimates suggest over 4,000 prisoners lived at the Barracks. By the spring of 1779, locals described the camp as a small town with a commissary store, a coffeehouse, and a theater. Despite these amenities, over 1,000 prisoners escaped between 1779 and 1780. Many of the German soldiers settled in the Shenandoah Valley and became American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Barracks Road Shopping Center</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barracksroad.com/ourcommunity.php&#34;&gt;Barracks Road Shopping Center&lt;/a&gt; is one of the oldest in the country, dating to 1959. To view the rest of this great old photograph of Barracks Road, see Cville Dave&amp;rsquo;s Posting on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cvilledave.blogspot.com/2007/01/barracks-road-shopping-center-early.html&#34;&gt;Barracks Road Shopping Center in the 1960s.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/barracks1960s.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Barracks Road, circa 1960s&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the photo you can see the newly built shopping center, mostly surrounded by woods, with large expanses of asphalt for the &amp;ldquo;acres of free parking&amp;rdquo; that was touted in the original advertisement. Built by an area developer, Rinehart, it displaced a famous tavern called Carroll&amp;rsquo;s Tea Room. Moore&amp;rsquo;s history of Charlottesville reports that although it often possessed neither tea nor room, it was &amp;ldquo;an oasis for thousands of thirsty university students.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/barrackslogo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Barracks Road Logo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look closely at the Barracks Road logo, found on signs along the edges of the retail center, you will notice a rider on a horse. This logo references the cavalry soldiers who manned the &amp;ldquo;Barracks.&amp;rdquo; The military barracks were constructed west of town near Ivy Farms during the Revolutionary War to house British and German prisoners-of-war.&lt;/p&gt;
