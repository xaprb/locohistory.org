      <title>Elks Club</title>

&lt;p&gt;The building may be vaguely familiar to modern-day Charlottesvillians&amp;hellip;perhaps the exposed brick side looks familiar ? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to place this building today because the portico and the moose have been removed (the four Corinthian columns in the front). The site is on East High Street, adjacent to the Old County Jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built in 1902, this was the home of the Charlottesville Lodge No. 389, B.P.O. Elks (organized in 1897). This building served as their headquarters for decades. In its heydey the lodge included a library, card room, bowling alley, pool and billiard parlor, buffet, baths, and a banquet hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/elksclub2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Juvenile Court Building (2002). Source Blair Hawkins.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Elks Club moved out, the building was converted to the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courthouse. After a 1940s fire, the facade was simplified, leaving only the pilasters (flattened columns). Since 2002 the building has been undergoing renovations. The renovations were significantly delayed after a wall collapsed in 2006. When completed the newest facade will differ even more from the original (Photo coming soon).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Historic Church Inspired by a Roman Temple</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2009/01/01/historic-church-inspired-by-a-roman-temple/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Walking down West Main Street takes you back in time, when Starr Hill referred to a neighborhood, not a brewery and when the Railroad was the main means of travel in and out of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/bethel2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Church (historic)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you keep your eyes peeled while walking you can spot century-old buildings, the structural remainders of those by-gone days. One beautiful example is a former church located on Commerce Street in the middle of the Starr Hill Neighborhood (bordering on the Vinegar Hill Neighborhood). This historic black church is surrounded by other structures associated with the African American community (e.g., the J.F. Bell Funeral Home, founded in 1917 and the Ebenezer Baptist Church, founded in 1892).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/bethel1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Church (2008)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until recently, the building was home to the Charlottesville Church of Christ. In 1990 the congregation moved to a new building on 5th Street. Earlier in the century a different, African American congregation used the building. According to Professor Emeritus K. Edward Lay, the church was founded in 1919 and called the Bethlehem Apostolic Church or the Bethel Baptist Church. The building was built several years later, in 1922, and featured a stuccoed building with a Corinthian Tetrastyle Portico and stained glass windows. Today the stucco has been replaced with wood and tiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building&amp;rsquo;s classical facade was inspired by Greek and Roman architectural styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/bethel_maisoncarree1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Maison Carreé in France (a Roman Temple)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the capitals at the tops of the corinthian columns are colored gold (although this seems to be a newly added decorative feature). The green tile is also a newer addition (compare the 2008 photo to the historic one). A wide staircase leads to the narrow portico (or porch). This architectural style dates back to Roman times. One of the best preserved examples of a Roman Temple (and the impetus for the church facade) is the Maison Carrée in France. It was built over 2000 years ago (in 16 B.C.E.) and survived, in large part, because it was converted to a Christian church in 4th century. Today it is a museum.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rosenwald Schools</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/09/29/rosenwald-schools/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 1910s, Julius Rosenwald (1862-1932) donated money to help Booker T. Washington fund six African-American schools in Alabama. The project was a success and soon thereafter Rosenwald (born to a Jewish family that had immigrated from Germany and later, co-owner of the Sears &amp;amp; Roebuck company) created the &amp;ldquo;Julius Rosenwald Fund&amp;rdquo; for African-American schools in the south. The goal of the project was to build new and innovative school houses (using, in part, Sears &amp;amp; Roebuck building kits). Rosenwald included a caveat, the entire community had to contribute money and labor to build the school and furnish it. During the 15 years of the fund’s existence (1917-1932), the Rosenwald fund helped finance 4,977 new schools, 217 teachers’ homes, and 163 shop buildings. In some communities these schools were the first formal school house, in others they replaced dilapidated and unsafe structures. In each case, this program encouraged communities to contribute to the construction of their school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/greenwoodschool_fisk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Greenwood School (Image from the Fisk Collections)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in Albemarle County almost a dozen Rosenwald schools were built. They were built between 1921 and 1926. Today, only a handful remain standing. Most of the schools sat on several acres and cost between $2000 and $3000. Here in Albemarle, the Rosenwald fund contributed about 30% of the total cost, the African-American community about 20%, and the remainder was given by &amp;ldquo;whites&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the public&amp;rdquo; (categories used by the fund in identifying donors). The schools were classified based on the number of teachers who taught in the building. In Greenwood they built a &amp;ldquo;two teacher&amp;rdquo; school (seen in the photo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://rosenwald.fisk.edu/&#34;&gt;Courtesy of the Fisk Collections&lt;/a&gt;). These schools continued to be used until desegregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you attended a Rosenwald School or have more information about Albemarle County Rosenwald Schools (or others in central Virginia) please contribute a comment below or contact me directly (lynn[at]locohistory.org). Here in Albemarle several members of the community have begun a project to research the history of these schools.[](&lt;a href=&#34;http://rosenwald.fisk.edu/&#34;&gt;http://rosenwald.fisk.edu/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Historic Bricks on the Downtown Mall</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/08/25/historic-bricks-on-the-downtown-mall/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2008 21:44:57 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/08/25/historic-bricks-on-the-downtown-mall/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/brick1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;brick1.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;history&amp;rdquo; in locohistory can be defined in a number of ways.  At its most basic, it is something that occurred in the past. For inclusion on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nps.gov/nr/&#34;&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; it should be at least fifty years old. The study of &amp;ldquo;history&amp;rdquo; includes past peoples, events, structures, and landscapes. This week&amp;rsquo;s post considers a slightly more recent event that occurred in 1976: the creation of the pedestrian mall on East Main Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/brick2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;brick2.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to prohibit cars from traveling (and parking) on a major thoroughfare was controversial. To demonstrate the utility of such a move, a smaller section (from the Belmont Bridge to West Second Street) was temporarily closed  on April 13, 1971 and set up as a pedestrian shopping center. Still, the proposed mall project was variously derided as â€œColeâ€™s Holeâ€ (the city manager at that time was Cole Hendrix), â€œCouncilâ€™s Follyâ€ and â€œLittle Watergate.â€&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/brick3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;brick3.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other sites have comprehensive coverage of the long road that was traveled before the completion of the mall and its even more gradual success as a social and shopping mecca. One excellent article is by John Yellig, available &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/downtown_mall_charlottesvilles_public_square/6639/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post my mission is different: to encourage you to look down at the architecturally designed roadway and its bricks.  The architect is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Lawrence_Halprin.html&#34;&gt;Lawrence Halprin&lt;/a&gt; who specifically designed a brick walkway that would not detract from the surrounding historic, brick structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/brick4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;brick4.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, he selected an unusual shape, 4â€ by 12â€ pavers, so that they would look  artistic, not &amp;ldquo;institutional.&amp;rdquo; Halprin is a well known architect and is known for creating &amp;ldquo;landscapes available to all segments of society and generated on the basis of final user needs.&amp;rdquo; His 1976 artistic design has recently come under discussion as the City pursues options for renovating the downtown mall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/brick5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;brick5.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To listen to a podcast of public comment on the plan for the new bricks, visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cvilletomorrow.typepad.com/charlottesville_tomorrow_/2008/07/downtown_mall.html&#34;&gt;Charlottesville Tomorrow Website&lt;/a&gt;. There has been a lot of public input into the use of 7.5 million dollars to refurbish the bricks and if the money is to be spent, how to produce an aesthetically pleasing result on time and on budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here at locohistory we wanted to take a different approach and see just how well you know your downtown mall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/brick6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;brick6.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the following exercise it helps to enlist kids as they are closer to the ground and more likely to be successful in completing the following challenge.  Or you can  add this treasure hunt to your weekend pub crawl and see who finishes first. &lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt; for the First (and quite possibly final seeing as they may be removing these bricks in 2009) Annual Downtown Mall Brick Challenge: Begin at the Omni, face east (towards the Pavilion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/brick7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;brick7.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how many of the brick &amp;ldquo;hot spots&amp;rdquo; you can find (numbered throughout this post). Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to look up and watch out for pedestrians and the cars at the two drive through crossings. For bonus points, complete this challenge from memory and see if you recognize any of these spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/brick8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;brick8.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/brick9.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;brick9.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/brick10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;brick10.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hunting for Historic Graffiti</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/07/07/hunting-for-historic-graffiti/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On some downtown structures history is writ large on the sides of old, brick buildings. The images below represent a small sample of the 19th and early 20th century advertising technique of painting buildings. See how many old store names you can locate on and around the mall this summer. A hint: the photos illustrated here were taken near East Water Street and 4th Street SE. Ironically, the brand-new building in the back of the &amp;ldquo;Chas King Grocers&amp;rdquo; building is &amp;ldquo;the Holsinger,&amp;rdquo; named after a famous, historic photographer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/histgraffiti.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;histgraffiti.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more photos of local graffiti visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://albemarlehistory.org&#34;&gt;Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society&lt;/a&gt; website which contains a &lt;a href=&#34;http://albemarlehistory.org/Ghost%20signs/rebholz_.html&#34;&gt;photo essay by Glenn Rebholz&lt;/a&gt;.  He photographed dozens of examples from downtown Charlottesville. His on-line exhibit is titled: Ghost Signs and Vestige Billboards. The accompanying report is on file at the historical society.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Breezy Oaks: A Keswick Farmhouse</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/03/13/breezy-oaks-a-keswick-farmhouse/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2008 19:58:07 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/03/13/breezy-oaks-a-keswick-farmhouse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago I visited an unmarked graveyard off Route 22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/ccg_gs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;An un-inscribed fieldstone in the cemetery.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today located on private property, adjacent to a 20th Century house, the fieldstones in the graveyard dated to an earlier period. The un-inscribed stones suggested an informal, family graveyard, most likely used by individuals who could not afford mass-produced markers.  With no names or dates, I filed the cemetery away for later research (such as deed and census analysis to try to figure out who owned the land 100+ years ago).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, I saw an intriguing advertisement for a house (MLS 437142) located only half-a-mile from the old graveyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/ccg_breezyoakshse1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Breezy Oaks (in 2008). Built circa 1882/1889.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description caught my attention: &amp;ldquo;Albert Johnson was a freed slave who obtained this property from the Meriwether and Randolph families. Construction started in 1882 with the western-most portion (one over one over one with access via rope ladders). The eastern portion was build in 1889.&amp;rdquo; I turned to UVA architectural historian emeritus, K.  Edward Lay, to learn more. He had studied the house as part of his research into historic homes in Albemarle County (see his book for more information: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.upress.virginia.edu/books/lay.html&#34;&gt;The Architecture of Jefferson County&lt;/a&gt;). According to Professor Lay,  Albert Johnson was a black carpenter living on land given to Blacks after Civil War. In the 1880 Census, Albert Johnson is listed as age 35 (born in slavery, around 1845), married to Amity Johnson (also 35) and living with their six children and one other boy (possibly a relative, Jesse Spencer, age 17).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/ccg_breezyoaksplan.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Professor Ed Layâ€™s Architectual Drawing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further inquiries with neighbors, Mrs. G. and Sara Lee Barnes, revealed  that at some point between the first and second quarter of the 20th century the house was purchased by a white family named Dowell.  For much of the 20th Century, Mrs. Dowell and her children lived very simply in the house. Mrs Dowell lived to be over one hundred years old. After her death, her daughter Lyndell stayed in the house for some years. After she was no longer able to take care of herself, the house was sold out of the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kitchen contains logs said to have come from Monticello or possibly Shadwell (Mr Johnson once lived and worked at the former). A modern bathroom was tacked on at the rear of the house sometime in the 20th century (seen in the photo below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/ccg_breezyoakshse2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rear view of the house with a cinder block bathroom attached.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beautiful oaks in the yard were planted by Mr. Johnson. So while the house lacks central heat or air, it retains the beauty of past craftsmanship (only slightly obscured by cheap paneling and carpeting). Ms Barnes commented that this was one of three homes in the immediate vicinity that were originally built by freed slaves for their families. One (or all) of these homes may have used the graveyard located nearby. Located off busy Route 22 in Keswick, this is the house that time forgot. Hopefully it will be bought and restored, rather than torn down.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mountain View Baptist Church in Batesville</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/10/15/mountain-view-baptist-church-in-batesville/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the wonderful things about living in central Virginia is the beautiful fall weather, perfect for exploring back country roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/mtviewchurch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mountain View Baptist Church (2007)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along a recent trip, I came across a 100-year-old African-American Church: Mountain View Baptist, located in downtown Batesville. Located on a steep hillside, the original stone foundation and steeple lie in the center. While there is no contiguous cemetery, an historic black cemetery lies about half-a-mile to the north of the church, adjacent to the Wild Rose Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/mtview1909.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mountain View Baptist Church (1909)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward K. Lay discusses the architectural features of this church in his book, _The Architecture of Jefferson country: Charlottesville and Albemarle County, Virginia. _To view historic photographs of the century-old church, visit Professor Lay&amp;rsquo;s on-line digital collection of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lib.virginia.edu/digital/collections/image/jefferson_country.html&#34;&gt;The Architecture of  Jefferson Country&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Note, &amp;ldquo;Jefferson Country&amp;rdquo; is a moniker for Charlottesville and Albemarle County.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Man, A Principal, A Park, A Gravestone</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before desegregation, the only Charlottesville high school open to African Americans was the Jefferson School. Built in 1926, the building is located on Fourth Street at the edge of the old Vinegar Hill neighborhood. The school opened several decades earlier, in 1894, as the nine-room, K-8 &amp;ldquo;Jefferson Colored Graded/Elementary School&amp;rdquo; (that building was demolished in 1959). An informal precursor to the school dates to the 1860s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first principal of the &amp;ldquo;Graded School&amp;rdquo; was Benjamin E. Tonsler (1854-1917).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/tonsler_gs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tonsler_gs.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He received his degree at Hampton University and went on to serve as the principal of the Jefferson School for thirty years. In this post we highlight material culture that remains today to commemorate this man&amp;rsquo;s life and works. First, his gravestone was &amp;ldquo;Erected by the Alumni of the Jefferson Graded School and Friends&amp;rdquo; in his memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/tonsler_flowers.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tonsler_flowers.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His inscription reads &amp;ldquo;Gone But Not Forgotten.&amp;rdquo; This stone can be found within the Tonsler Family Plot in the Daughters of Zion Cemetery, located adjacent to the Oakwood Cemetery. Second, his house still stands on Sixth Street (behind the First Baptist Church on Main Street).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we check the University of Virginia historic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.virginia.edu/small/collections/holsinger/&#34;&gt;Holsinger Collection&lt;/a&gt; we locate a third memorial, a photograph of the funeral flowers brought to his house. And fourth, we remember his life in the name of the park located at the corner of Ridge and Cherry: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.charlottesville.org/Index.aspx?page=406&#34;&gt;Tonsler Park&lt;/a&gt; (the name was choosen in 1958).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One man&amp;rsquo;s biography writ large around us, if we only take the time to notice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summer Vacation: Fry&#39;s Spring</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/06/22/summer-vacation-frys-spring/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Editorial note: I will be in the field for much of the next two months so there will only be occasional posts during this time. Don&amp;rsquo;t give up, in late August more regular posts will return. In the meantime, scroll through the &amp;ldquo;Archives&amp;rdquo; at the left and catch up on past locog&amp;rsquo;s or check out some of the links to other historical sites under the &amp;ldquo;links&amp;rdquo; menu at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I go, a post on summer vacation&amp;rsquo;s past: Fry&amp;rsquo;s Spring. Although hard to believe today, in the 19thC Fry&amp;rsquo;s Spring was at the end of the street-car line and,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/trolleycarfrysprings.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dukeâ€™s Trolley to Fryâ€™s Spring (Duke Collection, University of Virginia Library)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;even earlier, was considered a country retreat. The &amp;ldquo;Fry&amp;rdquo; refers to James Francis Fry who was given 300 acres along Moore&amp;rsquo;s Creek in 1839 by his father-in-law. In 1875, Captain James A. Harris purchased a much smaller lot within the original boundary and it became a popular spot for leisure activities. Earlier, in the 1850s, the spring became known for its &amp;ldquo;healing waters.&amp;rdquo; With the introduction of an electric trolley in 1895, Fry&amp;rsquo;s Spring became even more popular and the owners introduced a dance pavilion, theater, and amusement park rides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other origins for modern-day names in this neighborhood: (1) James Fry built a house called Azelea Hall (hence the modern-day &amp;lsquo;Azelea Park&amp;rsquo;). (2) The Jefferson Park Hotel was built nearby in 1892 (preserved in the modern-day street name, Jefferson Park Avenue, usually shortened to JPA). The hotel burned in 1910 and was replaced by the current building associated with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fsbc.net/&#34;&gt;Fry&amp;rsquo;s Spring Beach Club.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information the neighborhood and Beach Club, visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://avenue.org/fsna/news.html&#34;&gt;Fry Spring&amp;rsquo;s Neighborhood Association&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&#34;http://cvilledesign.org/neighborhoods//index.cfm/fuseaction/viewpage/page_id/58?CFID=&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;Charlottesville Community Design Center&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fsbc.net/about_history.html&#34;&gt;history section of the FS Beach Club&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Park in a Driveway; Drive on Park Street</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/06/19/park-in-a-driveway-drive-on-park-street/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Park Street begins at E Jefferson (near the courthouse) and continues north to Melbourne Road (where it becomes Rio Road). Although Park Street contains beautiful homes, it does not contain a &amp;ldquo;park.&amp;rdquo; However, if you head north on Park St and cross the county line you will eventually reach a park (technically located off Rio Road) called Pen Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/parkstsigns.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The many Park Streets&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, however, is not the eponymous &amp;ldquo;park.&amp;rdquo; Rather, Park Street was named after Park Mill, owned by the same person who owned the plantation at Pen Park: Dr George Gilmer. Dr. Gilmer and his family lived at Pen Park from 1777 to 1800; many of these individuals are buried on the premise in a family cemetery. The mill was located along Meadow Creek. Today a sign marks the spot with its earlier name: Cochran&amp;rsquo;s Mill (built around 1754). All that remains standing today is the miller&amp;rsquo;s house, the mill has long since washed away (as it was located closer to the river, in the floodplain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, variants on the name &amp;ldquo;Park&amp;rdquo; have been added within the last several decades to 2oth Century streets, such as &amp;ldquo;Parkway&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Park Plaza.&amp;rdquo; These were not formal streets in the 19th Century. If anyone knows the origins of &amp;ldquo;Park Hill,&amp;rdquo; please leave a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Water Street &amp; Well Wishes</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/06/04/water-street-well-wishes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/wackywell1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A wooden artifact discovered during construction&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction in historic Charlottesville can sometimes net unexpected results. Recently, City workers were digging off the downtown mall and came across an odd piece of wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/wackywell2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Artifact Pieces&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they took the care to stop and remove the artifact in one piece, we get a glimpse into 19thC water technology. The artifact is part of an old well. The wooden piece is the bouyant part within the well (floating in the water). The accompanying metal pieces secure the wood within the well and allow it to open and close the opening to the well. Because we know the provenience of the artifact, the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society was able to research the origins of the well. Below is a map of the find spot, with the well (shown here on a city plan) highlighted in orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/wackywellmap.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Find spot of the well&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the map, you will notice that the well was dug at the corner of Main and Second Street. If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound familiar, try Water Street &amp;amp; 2nd Street (the contemporary street names). This well and many others like it explain the origin for the name &amp;ldquo;Water Street.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Historic Jail</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/05/30/historic-jail/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2007 01:50:06 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/05/30/historic-jail/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What has 3-feet thick walls, reinforced steel doors, an iron cage, and is surrounded by an 18-foot high wall ? A good guess would be the 1876 Charlottesville Jail (the first Albemarle County Jail was built in 1749). You probably drive by the jail frequently, without noticing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/jail.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;â€œOld Jailâ€ in Charlotesville&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sits behind the juvenile court offices, off E High and Park Street (near Hedge Street). Inmates were segregated by gender and race, with a 30-minute window for visitors, from noon until 12:30. The jail held between 35 and 40 inmates. Visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.albemarleso.org/history.html&#34;&gt;Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Office website&lt;/a&gt; for more details and an old photograph of the jail. An adjacent house was added in the early 20th Century for the jailer and his wife. The &amp;ldquo;Old Jail&amp;rdquo; closed in 1974 (when the modern Albemarle-Charlottesville Joint Security Complex opened on 5th Street Extended).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enslaved Community at UVA</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/05/22/enslaved-community-at-uva/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2007 21:34:41 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/05/22/enslaved-community-at-uva/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=1933&#34;&gt;apologizing for slavery&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Virginia created a committee charged with researching the enslaved and Free Black community at the university. Although these individuals are not (yet) featured prominently in histories of &amp;ldquo;Mr Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s University,&amp;rdquo; they provided much of the labor that constructed the original buildings, ca. 1819-1828. And, up until Emancipation, many professors and students lived with enslaved individuals on grounds. In addition, throughout the 19th Century, the university was surrounded by several African-American neighborhoods (e.g., Canada, located south of Cabell Hall and the site of the Foster House and Cemetery).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memorials to the African-American community are scattered throughout grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/crackerbox1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Crackerbox on the UVA Campus&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is the &amp;ldquo;crackerbox&amp;rdquo; (allegedly named after 19th Century students from Georgia who were called &amp;ldquo;crackers&amp;rdquo;). This small building, located behind Hotel F, has a rich oral history including references to a bordello, a 19th-kitchen, a woodshed, &amp;ldquo;the smallest dormitory in the United States,&amp;rdquo; and, quite possibly, slave quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/crackerbox2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hotel F and the â€œsmallest dormitory in the United Statesâ€&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a fascinating discussion of other campus buildings that may have been used by slaves or post-bellum servants, visit Jim Cocola&amp;rsquo;s on-line essay titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://faculty.virginia.edu/villagespaces/essay/#42e&#34;&gt;The Ideological Spaces of the Academical Village: A Reading of the Central Grounds at the  University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly formed university committee that is researching this forgotten history is hoping to compile any and all documents, oral histories, photographs, or family geneologies that relate to the enslaved and Free Black community at the university. A website dedicated to this project will be posted this summer. If you have information on this topic, please consider contributing it so that it can be compiled into formal accounts of the history of the university.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Imperial Tea, Mr Gleason, &amp; Old Albemarle Hotel</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/05/21/imperial-tea-mr-gleason-old-albemarle-hotel/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2007 13:40:36 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/05/21/imperial-tea-mr-gleason-old-albemarle-hotel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/gleason1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gleason Hotel / Old Albemarle Hotel&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are 100s of hotels in Charlottesville today, one of the most historic is the Gleason Hotel (today referred to as the Old Albemarle Hotel). Located on Main Street, near the Amtrak Station, the building has been repainted in a bright yellow, with white trim. The hotel was built in 1897 by Michael S. Gleason for $12,000. Next door, Hase&amp;rsquo;s Imperial Cafe was built for $3000. The name &amp;ldquo;Albemarle Hotel&amp;rdquo; dates to the 1930s when the original owners went bankrupt and sold the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/gleason2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rear of the Gleason Hotel / Old Albemarle Hotel&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel was condemned in 1976. Today it operates as a series of shops with apartments above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple renovations left their imprint and provide a treasure map for curious passerbys. For example, if you go around to the back of the hotel you will see the remnants of plain &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/02/18/structural-stars/&#34;&gt;structural stars&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; for providing support between the stories. You will also notice a technique called &amp;ldquo;quoining&amp;rdquo; (the non-linear vertical brick work), used to enhance the support for the corners of buildings. The location of this feature suggests that this was originally the corner of the building, with a later addition visible today. If you look along the western side of the building you will see the remains of staircases and if you continue to study the brickwork you will realize that there was once a contiguous building on this side. The front of the building contains numerous architectural features: Corinthian columns,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/gleason3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Victorian Elements on the front of the Hotel&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a recessed loggia (the ground floor gallery that is open to the street), and brick pilasters (rectangular columns).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel is on the national historic register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/gleason5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Historic Photograph of the Hotel Gleason&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Main St.). You will need adobe acrobat to read the file. An historic photo of the building is provided to illustrate the once continguous buildings.

      <title>Fire Plaques</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/05/13/fire-plaques/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 May 2007 22:48:26 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/05/13/fire-plaques/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you look carefully, you will notice that downtown historic structures occasionally have a metal plaque next to the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/fireplaque.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fire Marks&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one shown below is at 111 Main Street, the former residence of John Vowles, dating to the 1820s. These metal plaques were provided by fire insurance companies as a proof of purchase. If the home (and all of its papers) burned down, the plaque would remain to prove that the homeowner had purchased insurance. Ingenious. Who can say in today&amp;rsquo;s high tech world whether any file (electronic or paper) would survive a house fire ? The mark shown here is from the Fire Association Of Philadelphia. Visit an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hammerdown.com/marks.html&#34;&gt;external site&lt;/a&gt; to view some of the images from other insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/fireplaque2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fire Marks - Whereâ€™s Waldo ?&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then keep your eyes peeled when you&amp;rsquo;re walking downtown. They are rare, but several buildings have these marks&amp;hellip;.can anyone find the one below ? Hint: the color surrounding the plaque is from the color of the front porch of the house. Although it won&amp;rsquo;t help you find it, the image identifies the mark as belonging to the Firemen&amp;rsquo;s Insurance Company, Baltimore, Maryland. This particular policy was issued c. 1835 and contains a wonderful drawing of an old-fashioned water pump.&lt;/p&gt;
