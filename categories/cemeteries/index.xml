      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does an obelisk symbolize? Who is a &amp;ldquo;relict&amp;rdquo;? How do you figure out which stones are &amp;ldquo;headstones&amp;rdquo; and which are &amp;ldquo;footstones&amp;rdquo; associated with family monuments? To answer these questions, Dr. Lynn Rainville is offering a new course on &amp;ldquo;Death and Dying in Albemarle County&amp;rdquo; this Fall (2012) through UVA&amp;rsquo;s School of Continuing and Professional Studies. The class will meet Thursday nights from October 25 through December 13 (no class on November 22), from 7pm to 9pm at Darden (classroom TBA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DeathDying.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief description of the class: This course surveys 300 years of local mortuary practices, from Native American burial mounds to modern memorial parks. This overview includes a study of gravestone iconography, changing mortuary rituals, and cemetery landscapes.  The goal will be to reconstruct the lives of the dead as well as the beliefs of those that buried them. Visits to nearby graveyards will supplement in-class lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more or register, please visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scps.virginia.edu/programs/personal-enrichment-classes-fall2012&#34;&gt;SCPS Fall Course List&lt;/a&gt; (with lots of great classes). Scroll to the bottom of the page to find the &amp;ldquo;Death&amp;rdquo; class (NCSS 123 / 21193).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Birckhead Family Cemetery</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2012/04/06/birckhead-family-cemetery/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Old family cemeteries are often subsumed by modern developments, roads, and construction projects. In this case, a northern-Albemarle cemetery was enveloped by a series of new town houses, just west of the Target/Kohl&amp;rsquo;s mall and Route 29.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/birckhead-family-cemetery-lockwood-drive.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Birckhead Family Cemetery&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photo above, taken by Rob Eastman, shows the cemetery tightly packed in between houses. Fortunately, a metal fence was erected recently to protect the graves. The modest markers are paired head and footstones (as shown in the close-up below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/birckhead_hdstes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family patriarch was Samuel B. Birckhead a white man born in 1815 or 1817. He married Adeline Jane Durrett in 1848 and died in 1905. For more information on Samuel, please visit a &lt;a href=&#34;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~stevestevens/all/12649.htm&#34;&gt;genealogical site hosted by a descendant&lt;/a&gt;. The cemetery was originally part of a family farm was owned by Thomas Mann Birckhead (born in 1852). For more information on Thomas, please visit an &lt;a href=&#34;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~stevestevens/all/12561.htm&#34;&gt;external site here&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks are due to Mr. Eastman for bringing this site to my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I am not entirely certain &amp;lsquo;who,&amp;rsquo; I would assume that it was the  developers who cleaned up the site and put in the fence. The photo  below, taken by the genealogist mentioned above, shows the overgrown  condition of the cemetery as of 2006. The original photograph can be seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~stevestevens/all/12649_1_samuel_birckhead_grave.jpg&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Attend a free lecture on local African-American Cemeteries by Dr. Lynn Rainville at the Jefferson-Madison Regional Library Sunday, February 5th at 2pm in the McIntire Room (third floor, central branch of the library). Professor Rainville will discuss her research into historic, black burial grounds and the associated mortuary beliefs and funerary patterns. Come learn more about these &amp;ldquo;outdoor museums&amp;rdquo; of African-American beliefs and family connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/cemtalk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the talk, explore a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/&#34;&gt;related website&lt;/a&gt; designed by Prof. Rainville that includes information about dozens of historic, black cemeteries in Albemarle and Amherst Counties. Below is an excerpt from a walking tour of Charlottesville&amp;rsquo;s historic Daughters of Zion Cemetery (located minutes away from the Downtown Mall). Clicking on the image will take you to a virtual tour but please get out to see the real thing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spend this Memorial Day honoring some of Charlottesville&amp;rsquo;s former citizens and learning more about how Charlottesvillians from the past honored the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mpl_1913.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lynnrainville.org/&#34;&gt;Dr. Lynn Rainville&lt;/a&gt; (anthropologist and historian) on a one-hour tour of one of Charlottesville&amp;rsquo;s most historic graveyards, Maplewood Cemetery (&lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=maplewood+cemetery,+charlottesville,+va&amp;amp;aq=&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=72.059064,81.298828&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=maplewood+cemetery,&amp;amp;hnear=Charlottesville,+Virginia&amp;amp;ll=38.033169,-78.473808&amp;amp;spn=0.008797,0.009924&amp;amp;z=17&#34;&gt;located behind Martha Jefferson Hospital&lt;/a&gt;). Learn about historic gravestone symbols, mortuary rituals, and funerals from bygone eras. Find out why Victorian mothers were encouraged to take their children on strolls through the landscapes of the dead. And get a sneak-peak into the lives of 19th-century Charlottesvillians (these individuals will return later this year during the Society&amp;rsquo;s October Spirit Walk). Tickets are $5 a piece and must be reserved in advance.

      <title>Canada Community at UVA</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2011/05/10/canada-community-at-uva/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2011 15:18:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2011/05/10/canada-community-at-uva/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/05/22/enslaved-community-at-uva/&#34;&gt;posted in the past&lt;/a&gt; about the Kitty Foster site at UVA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/fostersitemap1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the University of Virginia dedicated a new park at the former site of Catherine Foster&amp;rsquo;s house and family burial ground.  Foster&amp;rsquo;s home was part of an antebellum community adjacent to the University named &amp;ldquo;Canada,&amp;rdquo; probably a reference to the Free Black population who lived there (slaves were emancipated in 1843 in Canada). Catherine &amp;ldquo;Kitty&amp;rdquo; Foster was a Free Black woman who purchased land for a house in 1833. Kitty was born around 1790 and later worked as a laundress for UVA faculty and students. When she died in 1863, the land was subdivided among her descendants and remained in the family until about 1906 when the property was sold to white developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archaeological investigations at the house site have uncovered ceramic sherds, glass shards, animal bones, nails, and a cobblestone path that relate to the everyday activities conducted here. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rivarch.com/&#34;&gt;Rivanna Archaeological Services&lt;/a&gt; produced a comprehensive report on these findings and the historical context of the Foster family in a report titled, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u5190389&#34;&gt;The Foster Family-Venable Lane Site: Report of Archaeological Investigations&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1993 a coffin was located at the site during the construction of a parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/fostersite52.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an initial archaeological survey in the 1990s, Rivanna Archaeological Services returned in 2002 and 2005 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virginia.edu/insideuva/2005/11/gravesite.html&#34;&gt;read more about their findings in 2005&lt;/a&gt;) to locate additional unmarked graves, totaling 32 individuals (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2005/foster-june-8-2005.html&#34;&gt;read the story here&lt;/a&gt;). Because of their proximity to the house, these remains are believed to be relatives of Kitty Foster. After locating the burials, the human remains were recovered and left undisturbed (the photo illustrates a re-landscaping effort to indicate the location of the unmarked burials).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/fostersite4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more recent dedication ceremony included a newly constructed &amp;ldquo;shadow catcher&amp;rdquo; designed by Walter Hood and Cheryl Barton. This metal structure casts a shadow over the location of the cemetery and symbolizes an abstract outline of the house and its chimney.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hungrytown (Part II)</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2009/09/13/hungrytown-part-ii/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2009 21:13:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2009/09/13/hungrytown-part-ii/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I published a post about Hungrytown, in southern Albemarle County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/hungrytownhouse.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;An historic cabin in Hungrytown&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I received an email from a descendant asking about a nearby cemetery. I visited the cemetery a number of years ago. It contains the graves of families who lived in the neighborhood: Toms, Meltons, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/hungrytowncem4-128x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately only one stone is inscribed: that of a veteran, Wilton Toms (1828-1910) who served in the 46th Virginia Infantry during the Civil War. The stone was placed recently, in the past decade or so, to commemorate his service. The other family members are buried under fieldstones, some shaped, others plain. The fate of this cemetery - unmarked stones in a hard-to-find, rural location - is all too common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/hungrytowncem3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where rural communities once flourished and shared the knowledge of who was buried in which grave, today these neighborhoods are often unpopulated or the original residents (and their memories) are long gone. One option for preserving the location of historic burials is to install a metal plaque with a list of the names of the dead. This information could be collected from the memory of residents and family members. While it would not be possible, in most cases, to assign names to individual graves, a plaque would help preserve the family ties to the graveyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/hungrytowncem1-150x150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is submitting a list of burials and photographs to a nearby historical society and/or county planning department. That way there will be a paper trail for future researchers. Perhaps the most important strategy for protecting these sites is to keep the memory of the dead alive in the younger generations so that they feel connected to these sacred spaces, visit, and care for the graves. This is easier said than done, but making the effort will ensure that these historic burial grounds are not forgotten by the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Erasing Our Heritage One Gravestone at a Time</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/04/16/erasing-our-heritage-one-gravestone-at-a-time/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2008 01:55:12 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/04/16/erasing-our-heritage-one-gravestone-at-a-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently cemetery vandalism has been on the increase in our local cemeteries. The worst hit cemetery is the historic African American graveyard adjacent to Oakwood and known as the &amp;ldquo;Daughters of Zion&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Society Cemetery.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/mpl_vandal1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mpl_vandal1.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, vandalism has been increasing in Maplewood Cemetery (near Martha Jefferson Hospital). The perpetrators vary in age from teenagers to adults and from the homeless to school children. Gang-related graffiti has been found, etched on an obelisk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent spike in vandalism has decimated parts of Maplewood Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/mpl_vandal2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mpl_vandal2.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the photo (taken 14 April 08), the red dots indicate stones that have been broken, moved, or destroyed. In some cases the inscriptions are no longer legible and it will be very difficult (and expensive) to repair them.  To read more about these recent incidents, please visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nbc29.com/Global/story.asp?s=8120857&#34;&gt;NBC 29 website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the decline in cemetery landscapes is enabled because the average person never visits a cemetery. This disuse has led to abandoned acres of graves that are rarely visited by family members or the public. It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that our modern sensibilities discourage us from visiting and learning from these open-air museums. To the contrary, in the 19th Century families were encouraged to walk through the recently designed &amp;ldquo;rural cemeteries&amp;rdquo; (paradoxically located adjacent to cities). These burial grounds contained walking trails, sculpted shrubbery, and a Victorian style of funerary memorial that emphasized flowery inscriptions and moralistic epitaphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/mpl_vandal3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mpl_vandal3.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today these monuments are part of a 200-year old landscape at Maplewood Cemetery. A stroll through this historic deathscape illustrates past ideas about death, the family, religion, and gender. Moreover,  the epitaphs convey the history of Charlottesville, one individual at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlottesville has several historic cemeteries, all of which teach us about the city&amp;rsquo;s multi-cultural past. The current behavior of a small number of people can by stopped if more people strolled through these graveyards and called the Police if they see something amiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Charlottesville Police Officer has dedicated a portion of her time to working on this issue. If you see vandalism in progress in one of our city cemeteries, please call 911. To report a past incident, please call the non-emergency number, 977-9041 or Crime Stoppers at 977-4000. Other questions can be directed to me (via the contact form on the blog) or to Officer Weber at the Police Department (970-3280).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help monitor and protect these valuable resources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cities of the Dead</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/12/20/cities-of-the-dead/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2007 14:40:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/12/20/cities-of-the-dead/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 19th Century, American families strolled through public cemeteries in an effort to impart morals and religious ideals to their children. In the 20th century this practice became taboo, as the arena of death became professionalized (through the rise of Funeral Homes and morticians who took over tasks that had previously been performed by family members). But cemeteries still have a lot to teach us. Gravestone inscriptions reveal family values, kinship relations, religious beliefs, expected gender roles, and attitudes towards death. Mortuary motifs transform cultural ideologies into art and illustrate beliefs about life and death. And, taken as a whole, cemeteries preserve the memory of past communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/cemoverview.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cemoverview.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two public cemeteries in Charlottesville: Oakwood and Maplewood and many of the privately owned, large memorial parks allow pedestrian traffic. In all cases, respect is due to these sacred sites.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before desegregation, the only Charlottesville high school open to African Americans was the Jefferson School. Built in 1926, the building is located on Fourth Street at the edge of the old Vinegar Hill neighborhood. The school opened several decades earlier, in 1894, as the nine-room, K-8 &amp;ldquo;Jefferson Colored Graded/Elementary School&amp;rdquo; (that building was demolished in 1959). An informal precursor to the school dates to the 1860s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first principal of the &amp;ldquo;Graded School&amp;rdquo; was Benjamin E. Tonsler (1854-1917).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/tonsler_gs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tonsler_gs.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He received his degree at Hampton University and went on to serve as the principal of the Jefferson School for thirty years. In this post we highlight material culture that remains today to commemorate this man&amp;rsquo;s life and works. First, his gravestone was &amp;ldquo;Erected by the Alumni of the Jefferson Graded School and Friends&amp;rdquo; in his memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/tonsler_flowers.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tonsler_flowers.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His inscription reads &amp;ldquo;Gone But Not Forgotten.&amp;rdquo; This stone can be found within the Tonsler Family Plot in the Daughters of Zion Cemetery, located adjacent to the Oakwood Cemetery. Second, his house still stands on Sixth Street (behind the First Baptist Church on Main Street).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we check the University of Virginia historic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.virginia.edu/small/collections/holsinger/&#34;&gt;Holsinger Collection&lt;/a&gt; we locate a third memorial, a photograph of the funeral flowers brought to his house. And fourth, we remember his life in the name of the park located at the corner of Ridge and Cherry: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.charlottesville.org/Index.aspx?page=406&#34;&gt;Tonsler Park&lt;/a&gt; (the name was choosen in 1958).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One man&amp;rsquo;s biography writ large around us, if we only take the time to notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To read more about the history of the Jefferson School, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.charlottesville.org/Index.aspx?page=1608&#34;&gt;please visit a website that contains a link to a 46-page downloadable history&lt;/a&gt; that was compiled as part of efforts to nominate the school as a historic landmark. Preservation Piedmont conducted dozens of oral interviews with former teachers and students. Information on that project is &lt;a href=&#34;http://avenue.org/pp/jeff-school-oral-hx.html&#34;&gt;available on their website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Original Charlottesville Burial Ground</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 20th Century, there were three public cemeteries in Charlottesville: Maplewood (founded c. 1827), Oakwood (founded c. 1860), and Riverview (founded in 1887).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/graveyard_original.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;graveyard_original.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earlier graveyard pre-dates these, but its location is lost to the shadows of history. A rare reference to it is found in Moore&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Albemarle: Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s County&lt;/em&gt; (1976) who mentioned a burial ground &amp;ldquo;in a garden&amp;rdquo; off Park Street, near the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fpchurch.com/&#34;&gt;First Presbyterian Churc&lt;/a&gt;h. Today it is an empty lot along an otherwise densely packed street.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hugh Carr and Hiking Trails</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ivycreekfoundation.org/ICNA.html&#34;&gt;Ivy Creek Natural Area &lt;/a&gt;contains hiking trails, copious amounts of birds, and a learning center. In 1880, on this same site, Hugh Carr&amp;rsquo;s 80-acre farm, River View, contained crops, a milk cow, 4 swine, 10 poultry, and many other agricultural features. Although born into slavery around 1840, Hugh Carr worked hard after emancipation to save his earnings and invest in land in the Hydraulic Mills neighborhood (along the Rivanna). The &lt;a href=&#34;http://ivycreekfoundation.org/home.html&#34;&gt;Ivy Creek Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has conducted extensive research into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ivycreekfoundation.org/FamilyHistory.html&#34;&gt;Life &amp;amp; Legacy of the Carr family&lt;/a&gt;. Many 19th and 20th Century features are visible today: the original farmhouse, a clapboard barn, historic road beds, and springhouses. Make sure you visit the ICNF site before you go so that you can enjoy the rich history of this farm. &lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/carrcem.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Carr Family Cemetery&#34; /&gt;
During your visit, take a few moments to visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virginia.edu/woodson/projects/aacaac/db/cemetery/details/CRR/&#34;&gt;Carr Family Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. It contains an interesting array of granite and carved fieldstone gravemarkers.&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/monticellohotelsherd.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh Carr&amp;rsquo;s son-in-law, Conly Greer, contracted with several area businesses to haul away their trash. Many of these items, referred to by archaeologists as &amp;ldquo;artifacts&amp;rdquo; (it&amp;rsquo;s true, archaeologists study trash), are visible above-ground in trash middens. Below is a sherd with the profile of a famous Charlottesvillian which was the logo for the Old Monticello Hotel (located across from the courthouse).&lt;/p&gt;
