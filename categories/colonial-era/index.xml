      <title>Elks Club</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/elksclub1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Elks Club Building (c. 1907). Postcard courtesy of Steven G. Meeks.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building may be vaguely familiar to modern-day Charlottesvillians&amp;hellip;perhaps the exposed brick side looks familiar ? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to place this building today because the portico and the moose have been removed (the four Corinthian columns in the front). The site is on East High Street, adjacent to the Old County Jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built in 1902, this was the home of the Charlottesville Lodge No. 389, B.P.O. Elks (organized in 1897). This building served as their headquarters for decades. In its heydey the lodge included a library, card room, bowling alley, pool and billiard parlor, buffet, baths, and a banquet hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/elksclub2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Juvenile Court Building (2002). Source Blair Hawkins.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Elks Club moved out, the building was converted to the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courthouse. After a 1940s fire, the facade was simplified, leaving only the pilasters (flattened columns). Since 2002 the building has been undergoing renovations. The renovations were significantly delayed after a wall collapsed in 2006. When completed the newest facade will differ even more from the original (Photo coming soon).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Masonic Society: 14th Century, 1910, and 2008</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/08/04/masonic-society-14th-century-1910-and-2008/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Freemasonry emerged from the craft guilds of stone masons during the Middle Ages. This &amp;ldquo;secret society&amp;rdquo; became very popular in Colonial America and many of the founding fathers belonged to Masonic Societies, including George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and John Paul Jones (no, not the same eponymous individual who named the JPJ Arena here in C-ville; &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; John P. was a 1948 graduate of UVA Law). The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.msana.com/historyfm.asp&#34;&gt;Masonic Service Association&lt;/a&gt; website defines the organization as &amp;ldquo;a worldwide fraternity emphasizing       personal study, self-improvement, and social betterment via individual involvement       and philanthropy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/secretsoc_gs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;secretsoc_gs.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, these organizations were limited to men. But in the 19th Century several orders were created for women: The Order of the Eastern Star (1855), the Order of the Amaranth (1873), and the White Shrine of Jerusalem (1894). Often an individual&amp;rsquo;s membership in these groups was symbolized on their gravestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/secretsoc_tools.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;secretsoc_tools.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three symbols commonly used in these motifs include a carpenter&amp;rsquo;s t-square (for measuring accurate right angles), a compass (for drawing circles, not for navigating), and the letter &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; which is variously interpreted as &amp;ldquo;God,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Geometry,&amp;rdquo; or  &amp;ldquo;Grand Architect of the Universe&amp;rdquo; (also a reference to a higher power). The second photo illustrates Colonial Era tools used by builders and carpenters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in Charlottesville we have several Lodges and Chapters of the Masonic Temple. If we turn back to a C-ville City Directory from 1910-11 we see four groups: Widow&amp;rsquo;s Son Lodge, No 60 which meets &amp;ldquo;Friday on or before the full moon at 7:30 pm,&amp;rdquo;  the Charlottesville Lodge, No. 55 (also meeting before the full moon), the Keystone Royal Arch Chapter, No. 58 (which livened things up a bit and met the Friday &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the full moon),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/secretsoc_masons.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;secretsoc_masons.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the Charlottesville Commandry, No. 3 (which gave up on the celestial planning and settled for the &amp;ldquo;second Tuesday in each month.&amp;rdquo; The photo depicts one of the lodges today, located along the downtown mall. Stop by and study the symbolism in the various signs. Above the door is the classic triad. To the left of the door is a 3-D drawing that references the pyramids of Egypt (another important symbol for the group and the source of the &amp;ldquo;all-seeing&amp;rdquo; eye above the pyramid on the dollar bill). The detailed symbol on the glass door will make it easier to identify the symbolism of the T-square and compass.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Central Place</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/06/11/central-place/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Which C-ville landmark is referred to as &amp;ldquo;central place.&amp;rdquo; Could it be the Courthouse ? UVA ? Main Street ? The correct answer is the fountain located in the middle of the downtown mall. The fountain was designed, in part, to commemorate the wells that once lined Water Street and other downtown roads (see the earlier post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/06/03/water-street-well-wishes/&#34;&gt;Wells along Water Street&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/fountainmall.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Central Place Fountain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed by Lawrence Halprin, the fountain contains 3 concrete structures. They symbolize the three notches carved into trees that originally marked the path of &amp;ldquo;Three Notched (or Chopped) Road&amp;rdquo; (today&amp;rsquo;s Main Street / Route 250). If you look carefully as you stroll along the mall you&amp;rsquo;ll find the historic sign that describes the path of this early road. The fountain was dedicated in 1976, when the mall was re-opened as a pedestrian walkway. Ironically, it was meant to be a gathering place, but a metal chain was later installed to discourage people from going into the fountain. To learn more about the fountain, read The Hook&amp;rsquo;s article titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2007/01/18/ONARCH%200603.rtf.aspx&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fountainblue.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Swans, Cadavers, and Taverns</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/04/13/swans-cadavers-and-taverns/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you wander north of the downtown mall, start reading the slate signs mounted on many of the brick buildings and the sometimes hidden, grey metal historic markers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/swantav1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Swan Tavern Historic Marker&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This area, centered around the courthouse, contains dozens of old buildings. One famous example is the Swan Tavern, built sometime in the mid- to late-18th Century. The original structure was described in the early 1900s by Mr R Henry Carr (who was then 83 years old). He remembered it as a wooden building, with double porches, and a large picture of a swan for a sign. The tavern was originally operated by John Jewett, who owned it until his death in 1802. One commentator theorized that Jewett is buried in the lot alongside his beloved tavern. Sometime in the early 19th Century the tavern was abandoned. Sometime after that, a corpse was discovered in the ruins of the building, placed there by medical students who were getting in a little extra hands-on time with dissection techniques. In 1832 the ruin was replaced by the brick stucture that still stands today at the corner of E Jefferson and Park (today, the Red Land Club).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extraordinary Ordinaries</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/03/16/extraordinary-ordinaries/</link>

      <guid>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2007/03/16/extraordinary-ordinaries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is a colonial ordinary ? (a) a daily meal, consumed before dinner, (b) a second-rate menu item, &amp;copy; a tavern providing a meal at a set price. If you guessed &amp;ldquo;c&amp;rdquo; treat yourself to an extra dessert at your favorite modern-day inn. In the 18th Century, an Ordinary was an establishment that served meals and, sometimes, provided shelter. Ordinaries, later called taverns or inns, were spaced at regular intervals across the county so that travellers could rest and feed themselves and their horses. Historic Charlottesville had dozens of ordinaries. Alas, from all accounts they were nothing like today&amp;rsquo;s idyllic bed &amp;amp; breakfasts. Instead, the beds were often infested with bugs and vermin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/michiehoecakes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hoecakes!&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Moore (&lt;em&gt;Albemarle&lt;/em&gt;, 1976: 39) reports that a typical meal consisted of eggs, bacon, hoecake, and local moonshine, either peach brandy or whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/michietavernnew.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ambulatory Michie Tavern&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One famous local tavern was the Michie Tavern. Transcribed from the 1745 County Court Order Book, Mary Rawlings (194, MACH 5: 9) reported that the rates at Albemarle ordinaries included &amp;ldquo;good Virginia cyder by the quart&amp;rdquo; for 7 pence half penny; &amp;ldquo;a servant&amp;rsquo;s diet&amp;rdquo; for six pence; &amp;ldquo;peach brandy by the gallon&amp;rdquo; for 18 pence; and &amp;ldquo;Indian corn by the gall&amp;rdquo; for 4 pence (note to tourists: 12 pence=1 shilling; 20 shillings = 1 British pound) in today&amp;rsquo;s currency the &amp;ldquo;Virginia cyder&amp;rdquo; would cost about $7.60). If numismatics is your thing, I recommend the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ppoweruk/&#34;&gt;Measuring Worth&lt;/a&gt; site for all of your Colonial currency conversion needs.&lt;/p&gt;
