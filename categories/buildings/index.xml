      <title>Masonic Lodge</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/2008/08/04/masonic-lodge/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Freemasonry emerged from the craft guilds of stone masons during the Middle Ages. This &amp;ldquo;secret society&amp;rdquo; became very popular in Colonial America and many of the founding fathers belonged to Masonic Societies, including George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and John Paul Jones. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.msana.com/historyfm.asp&#34;&gt;Masonic Service Association&lt;/a&gt; website defines the organization as &amp;ldquo;a worldwide fraternity emphasizing personal study, self-improvement, and social betterment via individual involvement and philanthropy.&amp;ldquo; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/secretsoc_gs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;secretsoc_gs.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, these organizations were limited to men. But in the 19th Century several orders were created for women: The Order of the Eastern Star (1855), the Order of the Amaranth (1873), and the White Shrine of Jerusalem (1894). Often an individual&amp;rsquo;s membership in these groups was symbolized on their gravestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/secretsoc_tools.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;secretsoc_tools.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three symbols commonly used in these motifs include a carpenter&amp;rsquo;s t-square (for measuring accurate right angles), a compass (for drawing circles, not for navigating), and the letter &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; which is variously interpreted as &amp;ldquo;God,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Geometry,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Grand Architect of the Universe&amp;rdquo; (also a reference to a higher power). The second photo illustrates Colonial Era tools used by builders and carpenters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in Amherst a Masonic Lodge is located on Main Street. The Lodge is  the Clinton Lodge, No. 73.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/masoniclodge_amh.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;masoniclodge_amh.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look closely you will see the triple-symbol of the Masonic order (the t-square, compass, and &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo;). There is also a metal eagle to the left of the entrance, possibly associated with the order. One of the ironies of 21st Century life is that &amp;ldquo;secret societies&amp;rdquo; now have &lt;a href=&#34;http://vamason.org/no73/&#34;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt; that publicize their events (granted in somewhat cryptic fashion). This beautiful, old building has ornamental, corinthian columns, apropos of the order&amp;rsquo;s fascination with the classical world. The most well known example of this is the masonic symbol of the all-seeing eye that appears on the dollar bill, above an Egyptian pyramid.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(Original) Amherst Courthouse</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/2008/07/15/original-amherst-courthouse/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 19th Century, the local courthouse played an important social, economic, and legal role in the community. Most male citizens traveled to this locale several times a year: to pay taxes, dispute bills or land surveys, register property, and socialize with rarely seen residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/amhcthse_map.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;1864 Map of Amherst County (Source: Library of Congress)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local maps included this central location, usually with the abbreviation &amp;ldquo;C.H.&amp;rdquo; The excerpt above is from an 1864 map of Amherst. If you look closely you will see the Orange &amp;amp; Alexandria Railroad tracks and two of the &amp;ldquo;gaps&amp;rdquo; that led to the west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/amhcthse.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Courthouse (in 2007)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, most courthouses were part of a larger precinct that included the county jail,  lawyer&amp;rsquo;s offices, and an inn or tavern. In Amherst, the courthouse square originally included a hospital (later converted to a church), a prison, a post office, and the courthouse itself. The building was erected in 1870 and added on to in 1970 (the modern courthouse around the back of this building, not visible in the photo). A Civil War monument was placed in front of the old courthouse in 1922. A section of railing from the original courthouse was added to the second floor of the new courthouse. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virginiacourthouses.com/Amherst/Amherst.htm&#34;&gt;Allegedly this railing contains eight notches&lt;/a&gt; that correspond to the number of hangings conducted in front of the original courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sandidges Mill</title>
      <link>http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/2008/07/10/sandidges-mill/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Amherst County contains 100s of historic structures. Many of these buildings point to a by-gone lifestyle.  A perfect example is a mill. Once a necessity (for sawing lumber or processing grains), these businesses (and ruins thereof) were usually surrounded by a small community because it became an important location for trade, exchange, and the processing of goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s historic feature is the 1810s [corrected date, see comment below] Sandidges Mill, located in the eponymous town (west of Amherst, off Route 60). This small community once had a church, post office, and store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sandidge3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;An Old Advertisement for their Services (photo by Kelly Murphy and Jami Kontkanen)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the building lies in ruins, but you can still read the advertisement for &amp;ldquo;feed&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;flour&amp;rdquo; if you look carefully. They ground corn and flour for local farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photo below shows a mill race that once brought water to power the mill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sandidge2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mill Race at Sandidgesâ€™ Mill (photo by Kelly Murphy and Jami Kontkanen)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mill closed in 1942 and the usable equipment was taken to Brightwell&amp;rsquo;s Mill. If you visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://members.aol.com/achmuseum/muse/museoct05.html&#34;&gt;Amherst County Museum &amp;amp; Historical Society&lt;/a&gt; you can view an old pamphlet that illustrates milling equipment from Sandidges Mill.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A wealth of information about the county and its residents can be found at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://members.aol.com/achmuseum/achmhis.htm&#34;&gt;Amherst County Museum &amp;amp; Historical Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.locohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/kearfootwoodhse.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;kearfootwoodhse.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Museum offers permanent and changing exhibits, archival resources, lectures, and seasonal house tours and special events. Moreover, it serves up a slice of local history, from the historic house that it operates out of (the Kearfoot-Wood house, built in 1907 for a local pharmacist, Dr Kearfoot) to the artifacts that populate its exhibits. A family membership is only $20 a year. So for a little more than 5 cents a day you can help preserve and display local history. We begin this local county history blog (locohistory.org) at the museum, but in subsequent posts we will traverse the county and report on historic structures, artifacts, and stories from local residents. Please consider contributing an entry by emailing &amp;ldquo;lynn[at]locohistory.org&amp;rdquo; or by commenting on an existing post. Above all else - get out and enjoy the historic resources of Amherst County, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
