![Hungrytown on the Peyton Map (1875)](/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/hungrytownmap.jpg)

Where does the name "hungrytown" come from ? (a) the Great Depression when hobos visited houses in a vain hunt for food, (b) from Hungarian settlers who lived in the hollows of Virginia, (c) from an indigent community living in the area, (d) from a family named "Hungry". Unfortunately, I don't yet know the answer to this question, although A, B and C have are all part of local lore. I would suggest that "c" or "d" is the most likely. "A" is not possible because the names appears on an 1875 map, decades before the depression. "B" is off the wall, I have never heard of 19th Century Hungarians in Albemarle County.
