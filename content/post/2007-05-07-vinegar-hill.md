Today, the Vinegar Hill Theatre and Vinegar Hill Shopping Center are some of the only landmarks that preserve the name of an historic 20-acre neighborhood, previously located in a triangular area roughly bounded by West Main, Preston, and 4th Street. Up until the 1960s, Vinegar Hill was a thriving African-American community. The eastern edge of the community lies under today's Omni Hotel (#3 in the photo). [![Vinegar Hill: before and after](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/vinegarhilldemo.jpg)](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=112) The two photos illustrate the neighborhood before demolition (in 1957) and after (in 1966). The Jefferson School is #5 and #1 indicates the neighborhood itself. For comparison, I have added a red circle (the site of the Lewis & Clark Statue on Main St) and a feature highlighted in light blue in each photo. There are several useful on-line sources that document the history of this neighborhood: [an IATH project](http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/schwartz/vhill/vhill.html),     [Blair Hawkins' blog](http://super-blair.blogspot.com/2007/02/first-baptist-church-site-of-first.html) on a recent presentation about Vinegar Hill history given by Dr Scot French and Dr Reginald Butler, a [UVA site with historic photographs,](http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~aas405b/home.html) and a [Cavalier Daily article on Vinegar Hill](http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=4433&pid=581) reporting on a play written by Theresa Dowell-Vest.

This post is in honor of  new book on the neighborhood, _[In the Streets of Vinegar Hill](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?r=1&ean=9780595680153), _written by Mr. James A. Williams, Sr.

P.S. There is no consensus for the origin of the name: Vinegar Hill. Options include: (1) a tannery (that might have used vinegar to tan animals hides); (2) a tribute to the site of a fierce battle during the Irish rebellion of 1798; (3) a reference to bootlegged liquor. Have you heard other explanations ?
