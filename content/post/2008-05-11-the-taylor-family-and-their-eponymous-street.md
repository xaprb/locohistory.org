Much of local history lies in front of our eyes, but goes unnoticed. This is not the case with the Taylor Family. [![taylorsthistplaque.jpg](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/taylorsthistplaque.jpg)](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/05/10/the-taylor-family-and-their-eponymous-street/205/) The Martha Jefferson Neighborhood Association and Hospital combined to sponsor a marker that commemorates an African American family that has lived in the neighborhood for over 150 years. Quoting from the marker, "The land was originally part of a 25 acre parcel purchased in 1869 by Fairfax Taylor (1816-895). A former slave who bought his freedom and was the first black land owner in this area. Another member of the family, James T.S. Taylor (1840-1918) was active in politics and a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1867. Both were prominent members of the First Baptist Church and the community. As of this date [1993], their descendants live on family land in one of the three original Taylor houses."

Unfortunately, the street is no longer called "Taylor." Instead, the marker lies along Lexington avenue, just north of the Maplewood Cemetery.
