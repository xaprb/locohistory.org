Prior to the 20th Century, there were three public cemeteries in Charlottesville: Maplewood (founded c. 1827), Oakwood (founded c. 1860), and Riverview (founded in 1887). [![graveyard_original.jpg](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/graveyard_original.jpg)](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=86)An earlier graveyard pre-dates these, but its location is lost to the shadows of history. A rare reference to it is found in Moore's _Albemarle: Jefferson's County_ (1976) who mentioned a burial ground "in a garden" off Park Street, near the [First Presbyterian Churc](http://www.fpchurch.com/)h. Today it is an empty lot along an otherwise densely packed street.
