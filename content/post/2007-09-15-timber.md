Visit the Albemarle County Historical Society for their newest exhibit titled: **The Story of Albemarleâ€™s Trees and her Forest Industries. **

Quoting from the historical society website: "Trees were an integral part of early settlersâ€™ lives and work, and they fueled one of Albemarleâ€™s most important industries--lumber. The story of the trees--use, overuse, and conservation--is the story of the growth of the County, both socially and economically." This exhibit contains an array of material culture that pertains to forest products: from split-oak baskets to locally-made oak chairs, from wooden slats to forestry tools, from photographs to advertisements from area timber industries.




The exhibition was curated by Catherine Anne Daley, a University of Virginia summer intern through the Institute for Public History, with assistance from ACHS staff and volunteers.
