He married Adeline Jane Durrett in 1848 and died in 1905. For more information on Samuel, please visit a [genealogical site hosted by a descendant](http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~stevestevens/all/12649.htm). The cemetery was originally part of a family farm was owned by Thomas Mann Birckhead (born in 1852). For more information on Thomas, please visit an [external site here](http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~stevestevens/all/12561.htm). Thanks are due to Mr. Eastman for bringing this site to my attention.

Although I am not entirely certain 'who,' I would assume that it was the  developers who cleaned up the site and put in the fence. The photo  below, taken by the genealogist mentioned above, shows the overgrown  condition of the cemetery as of 2006.
