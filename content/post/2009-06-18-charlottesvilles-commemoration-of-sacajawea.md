She was the only woman on the mission and an invaluable guide, translator, and diplomat (smoothing relations between the anglos and Native Americans). The City of [Charlottesville's Historic Resource Committee](http://www.charlottesville.org/historicresources/) will be hosting a dedication of an historic plaque in honor of Sacajawea at 1pm at the "Lewis and Clark" statue. This will be followed by a discussion of "The Role of Art in Interpreting History" at 2pm at the [Charlottesville Design Center](http://www.cvilledesign.org) (at 100 5th St NE).
