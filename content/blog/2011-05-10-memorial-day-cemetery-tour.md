  <span class="description"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Spend this Memorial Day honoring some of Charlottesville&#8217;s former citizens and learning more about how Charlottesvillians from the past honored the dead. </span></span><a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mpl_1913.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-310" title="mpl_1913" src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mpl_1913.jpg" alt="" /></a><span class="description"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Join <a href="http://www.lynnrainville.org/">Dr. Lynn Rainville</a> (anthropologist and historian) on a one-hour tour of one of Charlottesville&#8217;s most historic graveyards, Maplewood Cemetery (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=maplewood+cemetery,+charlottesville,+va&aq=&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=72.059064,81.298828&ie=UTF8&hq=maplewood+cemetery,&hnear=Charlottesville,+Virginia&ll=38.033169,-78.473808&spn=0.008797,0.009924&z=17">located behind Martha Jefferson Hospital</a>). Learn about historic gravestone symbols, mortuary rituals, and funerals from bygone eras. Find out why Victorian mothers were encouraged to take their children on strolls through the landscapes of the dead. And get a sneak-peak into the lives of 19th-century Charlottesvillians (these individuals will return later this year during the Society&#8217;s October Spirit Walk). Tickets are $5 a piece and must be reserved in advance. All proceeds go to the <a href="http://www.albemarlehistory.org/">Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society</a> to support their efforts to preserve and promote local history.
