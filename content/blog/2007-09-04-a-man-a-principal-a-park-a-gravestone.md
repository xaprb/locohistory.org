Before desegregation, the only Charlottesville high school open to African Americans was the Jefferson School. Built in 1926, the building is located on Fourth Street at the edge of the old Vinegar Hill neighborhood. The school opened several decades earlier, in 1894, as the nine-room, K-8 "Jefferson Colored Graded/Elementary School" (that building was demolished in 1959). An informal precursor to the school dates to the 1860s.

The first principal of the "Graded School" was Benjamin E. Tonsler (1854-1917). [](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=151) His inscription reads "Gone But Not Forgotten." This stone can be found within the Tonsler Family Plot in the Daughters of Zion Cemetery, located adjacent to the Oakwood Cemetery. Second, his house still stands on Sixth Street (behind the First Baptist Church on Main Street).

If we check the University of Virginia historic [](http://www.lib.virginia.edu/small/collections/holsinger/) One man&#8217;s biography writ large around us, if we only take the time to notice.
