This Sunday the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society (ACHS) hosts an open quarterly meeting, for members and the public. The event is scheduled for Veteran&#8217;s Day, November 11th, at 2pm in the Emmanuel Church in Greenwood. The meeting will include the ACHS Annual Report, elections of officers, and an illustrated talk on the tree industry by Tom Dierauf (formerly with the Virginia Department of Forestry). After the talk there will be a chance to tour two lumber companies: Yancey (the origin of the name Yancey Mills) and J.B. Barnes. For more information (and directions), visit the <a href="http://www.albemarlehistory.org/" target="_blank">ACHS Website</a>.

When settlers first arrived in Albemarle they spent <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=168" rel="attachment wp-att-168" title="Former King Lumber Warehouse"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/kinglumberco.jpg" alt="Former King Lumber Warehouse" /></a> a great deal of time clearing the then heavily forested Piedmont. Shortly there after, this lumber was used to build houses and fences. In the early 20th Century, W.W. King built a warehouse for storing timber products, shown here in an old photograph (the warehouse, not Reid&#8217;s Supermarket). This company went out of business during the depression, but many other industries flourished and continue into the present. Come join us this Sunday to learn more about this historic industry.
