Freemasonry emerged from the craft guilds of stone masons during the Middle Ages. This &#8220;secret society&#8221; became very popular in Colonial America and many of the founding fathers belonged to Masonic Societies, including George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and John Paul Jones. The <a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/www.msana.com');" href="http://www.msana.com/historyfm.asp" target="_blank">Masonic Service Association</a> website defines the organization as &#8220;a worldwide fraternity emphasizing personal study, self-improvement, and social betterment via individual involvement and philanthropy.&#8221;Â  <a title="secretsoc_gs.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-221" href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/?attachment_id=221"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/secretsoc_gs.jpg" alt="secretsoc_gs.jpg" /></a>Originally, these organizations were limited to men. But in the 19th Century several orders were created for women: The Order of the Eastern Star (1855), the Order of the Amaranth (1873), and the White Shrine of Jerusalem (1894). Often an individual&#8217;s membership in these groups was symbolized on their gravestone. <a title="secretsoc_tools.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-222" href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/?attachment_id=222"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/secretsoc_tools.jpg" alt="secretsoc_tools.jpg" /></a> The three symbols commonly used in these motifs include a carpenter&#8217;s t-square (for measuring accurate right angles), a compass (for drawing circles, not for navigating), and the letter &#8220;G&#8221; which is variously interpreted as &#8220;God,&#8221; &#8220;Geometry,&#8221; or &#8220;Grand Architect of the Universe&#8221; (also a reference to a higher power). The second photo illustrates Colonial Era tools used by builders and carpenters.

Here in Amherst a Masonic Lodge is located on Main Street. The Lodge is the Clinton Lodge, No. 73. <a title="masoniclodge_amh.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-19" href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/?attachment_id=19"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/masoniclodge_amh.jpg" alt="masoniclodge_amh.jpg" /></a>If you look closely you will see the triple-symbol of the Masonic order (the t-square, compass, and &#8220;G&#8221;). There is also a metal eagle to the left of the entrance, possibly associated with the order. One of the ironies of 21st Century life is that &#8220;secret societies&#8221; now have [websites](http://vamason.org/no73/) that publicize their events (granted in somewhat cryptic fashion). This beautiful, old building has ornamental, corinthian columns, apropos of the order&#8217;s fascination with the classical world. The most well known example of this is the masonic symbol of the all-seeing eye that appears on the dollar bill, above an Egyptian pyramid.
