In the 19th Century, the local courthouse played an important social, economic, and legal role in the community. Most male citizens traveled to this locale several times a year: to pay taxes, dispute bills or land surveys, register property, and socialize with rarely seen residents. [Allegedly this railing contains eight notches](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/?attachment_id=16) that correspond to the number of hangings conducted in front of the original courthouse.
