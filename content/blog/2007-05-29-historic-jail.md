What has 3-feet thick walls, reinforced steel doors, an iron cage, and is surrounded by an 18-foot high wall ? A good guess would be the 1876 Charlottesville Jail (the first Albemarle County Jail was built in 1749). You probably drive by the jail frequently, without noticing it. <a href='http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=132' rel='attachment wp-att-132' title='â€œOld Jailâ€ in Charlotesville'><img src='http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/jail.jpg' alt='â€œOld Jailâ€ in Charlotesville' /></a>It sits behind the juvenile court offices, off E High and Park Street (near Hedge Street). Inmates were segregated by gender and race, with a 30-minute window for visitors, from noon until 12:30. The jail held between 35 and 40 inmates. Visit the [Sheriff&#8217;s Office website][1] for more details and an old photograph of the jail. An adjacent house was added in the early 20th Century for the jailer and his wife. The &#8220;Old Jail&#8221; closed in 1974 (when the modern Albemarle-Charlottesville Joint Security Complex opened on 5th Street Extended).
