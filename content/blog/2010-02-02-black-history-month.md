When Carter G. Woodson first proposed a celebration of African American culture and history it was designated as a &#8220;week.&#8221; First observed in 1926 he called it &#8220;Negro History Week.&#8221; In 1976 this evolved into &#8220;Black History Month.&#8221; Ideally every day of the year we would recognize the historical and cultural contributions of African Americans. In this blog I will focus on African America history in Amherst County for the next 4 weeks.

Several counties were founded in this region in the mid-18th century, including Amherst (in 1761). To understand the growth of the African-American population (both Free and enslaved), we turn to a quantifiable historic record, the first US Census, held in 1790. In that year 40% of Amherst County&#8217;s population was enslaved (Total population: 13,703; enslaved population 5,296; source [University of Virginia Historical Census Browser][2]). [<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-33" title="Map of Slavery in Virginia, 1860" src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/1860mapslaveryamherstsm-300x221.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="221" />][3]By 1860, on the eve of the Civil War, the enslaved population was 6,278 (after a peak of 7,462 in 1800). The maps (modified from the Census Browser) indicate the relative number of slaves in Amherst as compared to the surrounding Virginian counties. Note: in 1790 Amherst (&#8220;A&#8221; on the map) and Nelson (&#8220;N&#8221; on the map) were not yet separated and in both maps today&#8217;s West Virginia was still part of the state of Virginia.
