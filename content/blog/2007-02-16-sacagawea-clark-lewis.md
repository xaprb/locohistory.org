Quick quiz &#8211; where is Albemarle&#8217;s only statue of a Native American woman ? (Please email me if you know of others!) <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=47" rel="attachment wp-att-47" title="Close-up of Sacagawea in the Lewis & Clark Memorial"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/sacagewea.jpg" alt="Close-up of Sacagawea in the Lewis & Clark Memorial" align="left" /></a>She is hard to see, because she&#8217;s kneeling behind two men. But if you look closely at the Meriwether Lewis and William Clark statue at the intersection of West Main & Ridge Street (in downtown C-ville), you will see the Shoshone woman. Sacagawea, along with her husband Charbonneau, joined the Lewis & Clark Expedition in 1804, to serve as a translator. Visit the [SacajaweaHome website][1] or enter in her name in the search field at the on-line J[ournal of Lewis & Clark][2] for first-hand accounts about her from the Lewis & Clark diaries.

It was presented to C-ville in 1919, designed by Charles Keck and financed by Paul Goodloe McIntire. Take a closer look at the base of the statue for a glowing description of the westward mission and iconic images that illustrate their journey (notice the direction that the three figures are facing).
