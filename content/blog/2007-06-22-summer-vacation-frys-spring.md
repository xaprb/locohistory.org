Editorial note: I will be in the field for much of the next two months so there will only be occasional posts during this time. Don&#8217;t give up, in late August more regular posts will return. In the meantime, scroll through the &#8220;Archives&#8221; at the left and catch up on past locog&#8217;s or check out some of the links to other historical sites under the &#8220;links&#8221; menu at the top of the page.

Before I go, a post on summer vacation&#8217;s past: Fry&#8217;s Spring. Although hard to believe today, in the 19thC Fry&#8217;s Spring was at the end of the street-car line and, <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=141" rel="attachment wp-att-141" title="Dukeâ€™s Trolley to Fryâ€™s Spring (Duke Collection, University of Virginia Library)"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/trolleycarfrysprings.jpg" alt="Dukeâ€™s Trolley to Fryâ€™s Spring (Duke Collection, University of Virginia Library)" /></a>even earlier, was considered a country retreat. The &#8220;Fry&#8221; refers to James Francis Fry who was given 300 acres along Moore&#8217;s Creek in 1839 by his father-in-law. In 1875, Captain James A. Harris purchased a much smaller lot within the original boundary and it became a popular spot for leisure activities. Earlier, in the 1850s, the spring became known for its &#8220;healing waters.&#8221; With the introduction of an electric trolley in 1895, Fry&#8217;s Spring became even more popular and the owners introduced a dance pavilion, theater, and amusement park rides.
  
Other origins for modern-day names in this neighborhood: (1) James Fry built a house called Azelea Hall (hence the modern-day &#8216;Azelea Park&#8217;). (2) The Jefferson Park Hotel was built nearby in 1892 (preserved in the modern-day street name, Jefferson Park Avenue, usually shortened to JPA). The hotel burned in 1910 and was replaced by the current building associated with the <a href="http://fsbc.net/" target="_blank">Fry&#8217;s Spring Beach Club.</a>
