[](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/2007/04/07/hungrytown-part-i/hungrytown-on-the-peyton-map-1875/)Where does the name &#8220;hungrytown&#8221; come from ? (a) the Great Depression when hobos visited houses in a vain hunt for food, (b) from Hungarian settlers who lived in the hollows of Virginia, (c) from an indigent community living in the area, (d) from a family named &#8220;Hungry&#8221;. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t yet know the answer to this question, although A, B and C have are all part of local lore. I would suggest that &#8220;c&#8221; or &#8220;d&#8221; is the most likely. &#8220;A&#8221; is not possible because the names appears on an 1875 map, decades before the depression. &#8220;B&#8221; is off the wall, I have never heard of 19th Century Hungarians in Albemarle County.
