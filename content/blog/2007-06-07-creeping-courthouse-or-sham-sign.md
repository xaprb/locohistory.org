As mentioned in previous posts, the Division of Historic Resources places gray
and white signs at sites of historic interest. Charlottesville has dozens of
these signs, commemorating battles, individuals, historic structures, and
gravesites. The idea is to draw attention to historic spots. This becomes
slightly problematic when the historic sign is miles from the site itself. It’s
similar to finding a sign “to I-64″ on an Albemarle County road when you know
darn well that the entrance ramp is a dozen miles away. If you don’t look
carefully at the sign below you might assume that it commemorates the historic
courthouse in the background. Or perhaps Swan Tavern (across the street).

Instead, it commemorates the construction of Monticello (begun in 1770) and
Jefferson’s death there in 1826 (on the 4th of July). The signs confesses that
Monticello is 3 miles to the southeast. While a crow might make it within that
distance, a vehicle or lost tourist would not. But if all you’re after is a
scenic view, put your back to the sign and look carefully: the open hill-top
seen in the photo below is Jefferson’s “little mountain.”
