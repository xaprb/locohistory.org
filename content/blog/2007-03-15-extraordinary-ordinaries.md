What is a colonial ordinary ? (a) a daily meal, consumed before dinner, (b) a second-rate menu item, (c) a tavern providing a meal at a set price. If you guessed &#8220;c&#8221; treat yourself to an extra dessert at your favorite modern-day inn. In the 18th Century, an Ordinary was an establishment that served meals and, sometimes, provided shelter. Ordinaries, later called taverns or inns, were spaced at regular intervals across the county so that travellers could rest and feed themselves and their horses. Historic Charlottesville had dozens of ordinaries. Alas, from all accounts they were nothing like today&#8217;s idyllic bed & breakfasts. Instead, the beds were often infested with bugs and vermin.
