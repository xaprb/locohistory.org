Today, the Vinegar Hill Theatre and Vinegar Hill Shopping Center are some of the only landmarks that preserve the name of an historic 20-acre neighborhood, previously located in a triangular area roughly bounded by West Main, Preston, and 4th Street. Up until the 1960s, Vinegar Hill was a thriving African-American community. The eastern edge of the community lies under today&#8217;s Omni Hotel (#3 in the photo). <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=112" rel="attachment wp-att-112" title="Vinegar Hill: before and after"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/vinegarhilldemo.jpg" alt="Vinegar Hill: before and after" /></a> The two photos illustrate the neighborhood before demolition (in 1957) and after (in 1966). The Jefferson School is #5 and #1 indicates the neighborhood itself. For comparison, I have added a red circle (the site of the Lewis & Clark Statue on Main St) and a feature highlighted in light blue in each photo. There are several useful on-line sources that document the history of this neighborhood: <a href="http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/schwartz/vhill/vhill.html" target="_blank">an IATH project</a>, <a href="http://super-blair.blogspot.com/2007/02/first-baptist-church-site-of-first.html" target="_blank">Blair Hawkins&#8217; blog</a> on a recent presentation about Vinegar Hill history given by Dr Scot French and Dr Reginald Butler, a <a href="http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~aas405b/home.html" target="_blank">UVA site with historic photographs,</a> and a <a href="http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=4433&pid=581" target="_blank">Cavalier Daily article on Vinegar Hill</a> reporting on a play written by Theresa Dowell-Vest. For a <a href="http://albemarlehistory.org/vinegarhillslideshow.htm" target="_blank">slideshow of photos </a>from the neighborhood, visit the Albemarle County Historical Society website.

This post is in honor of new book on the neighborhood, _<a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?r=1&ean=9780595680153" target="_blank">In the Streets of Vinegar Hill</a>,_ written by Mr. James A. Williams, Sr.

P.S. There is no consensus for the origin of the name: Vinegar Hill. Options include: (1) a tannery (that might have used vinegar to tan animals hides); (2) a tribute to the site of a fierce battle during the Irish rebellion of 1798; (3) a reference to bootlegged liquor. Have you heard other explanations ?
