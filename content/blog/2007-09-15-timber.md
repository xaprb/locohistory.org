Visit the Albemarle County Historical Society for their newest exhibit titled: **The Story of Albemarleâ€™s Trees and her Forest Industries.** <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=154" rel="attachment wp-att-154" title="Baskets made from local timber products"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/timberbaskets.jpg" alt="Baskets made from local timber products" /></a>Quoting from the historical society website: &#8220;Trees were an integral part of early settlersâ€™ lives and work, and they fueled one of Albemarleâ€™s most important industries&#8211;lumber. The story of the trees&#8211;use, overuse, and conservation&#8211;is the story of the growth of the County, both socially and economically.&#8221; This exhibit contains an array of material culture that pertains to forest products: from split-oak baskets to locally-made oak chairs, from wooden slats to forestry tools, from photographs to advertisements from area timber industries.

The exhibition was curated by Catherine Anne Daley, a University of Virginia summer intern through the Institute for Public History, with assistance from ACHS staff and volunteers. <a href="http://www.albemarlehistory.org/" target="_blank">Click here to get more information about visiting the exhibition</a> (on display through Fall 2007).
