One of the wonderful things about living in central Virginia is the beautiful fall weather, perfect for exploring back country roads. <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=161" rel="attachment wp-att-161" title="Mountain View Baptist Church (2007)"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/mtviewchurch.jpg" alt="Mountain View Baptist Church (2007)" /></a> Along a recent trip, I came across a 100-year-old African-American Church: Mountain View Baptist, located in downtown Batesville. Located on a steep hillside, the original stone foundation and steeple lie in the center. While there is no contiguous cemetery, an historic black cemetery lies about half-a-mile to the north of the church, adjacent to the Wild Rose Cemetery. <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=162" rel="attachment wp-att-162" title="Mountain View Baptist Church (1909)"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/mtview1909.jpg" alt="Mountain View Baptist Church (1909)" /></a> Edward K. Lay discusses the architectural features of this church in his book, _The Architecture of Jefferson country: Charlottesville and Albemarle County, Virginia._ To view historic photographs of the century-old church, visit Professor Lay&#8217;s on-line digital collection of &#8220;<a href="http://lib.virginia.edu/digital/collections/image/jefferson_country.html" target="_blank">The Architecture of Jefferson Country</a>.&#8221; Note, &#8220;Jefferson Country&#8221; is a moniker for Charlottesville and Albemarle County.
