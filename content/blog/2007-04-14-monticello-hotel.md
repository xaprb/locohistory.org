This historic hotel wins the competition for most renditions of Jefferson's profile: on their plates and doormats, just to name a few.

One of its claims to fame was the "world's largest searchlight," mounted on top of the 9-story building and allegedly visible for 100s of miles.

In the photo below (taken in 2007), you can see the spot where the searchlight
was mounted (at the top of the building). The hotel closed in 1989 and was later
renovated into condominiums. Ironically, the hotel was originally slated to be
called the James Monroe, but the popularity of Jefferson, and his homestead, won
out.
