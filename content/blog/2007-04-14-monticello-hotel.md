excerpt: "This historic hotel wins the competition for most renditions of Jefferson's profile: on their plates and doormats, just to name a few. It began as a 21-foot deep pit, cost $800,000, and was originally slated to be called the James Monroe. Which Charlottesville hotel is it ?"

It was built in 1926 for $800,000.<a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=97" rel="attachment wp-att-97" title="Old Monticello Hotel"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/monthotbldg.jpg" alt="Old Monticello Hotel" /></a>

One of its claims to fame was the &#8220;world&#8217;s largest searchlight,&#8221; mounted on top of the 9-story building and allegedly visible for 100s of miles.Â <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=97" rel="attachment wp-att-97" title="Old Monticello Hotel"></a>In the photo below (taken in 2007), you can see the spot where the searchlight was mounted (at the top of the building). The hotel closed in 1989 and was later renovated into condominiums. Ironically, the hotel was originally slated to be called the James Monroe, but the popularity of Jefferson, and his homestead, won out. <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=97" rel="attachment wp-att-97" title="Old Monticello Hotel"></a>  <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=97" rel="attachment wp-att-97" title="Old Monticello Hotel"></a>
