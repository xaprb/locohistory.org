A wealth of information about the county and its residents can be found at the <a href="http://members.aol.com/achmuseum/achmhis.htm" target="_blank">Amherst County Museum & Historical Society</a>. <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/?attachment_id=5" rel="attachment wp-att-5" title="kearfootwoodhse.jpg"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/kearfootwoodhse.jpg" alt="kearfootwoodhse.jpg" /></a> The Museum offers permanent and changing exhibits, archival resources, lectures, and seasonal house tours and special events. Moreover, it serves up a slice of local history, from the historic house that it operates out of (the Kearfoot-Wood house, built in 1907 for a local pharmacist, Dr Kearfoot) to the artifacts that populate its exhibits. A family membership is only $20 a year. So for a little more than 5 cents a day you can help preserve and display local history. We begin this local county history blog (locohistory.org) at the museum, but in subsequent posts we will traverse the county and report on historic structures, artifacts, and stories from local residents. Please consider contributing an entry by emailing &#8220;lynn[at]locohistory.org&#8221; or by commenting on an existing post. Above all else &#8211; get out and enjoy the historic resources of Amherst County, Virginia.
