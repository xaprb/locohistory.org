The next time you&#8217;re viewing a map of the county, look along its western edge and look for the "gaps." [](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=101)Prior to construction of the Shenadoah National Park and Blue Ridge Parkway system, the Blue Ridge Mountains represented both a barrier and, through a system of highland valleys, a connection to the rest of the country. One such passage is named "Taylor&#8217;s Gap.&#8217; Like most of the gaps, they are named after former residents. This one is named after Benjamin Taylor (d. 1809), his wife, Mary, and their family. Taylor&#8217;s Gap Road is located near their former homestead even though the widow left for Georgia in 1811 after her husband&#8217;s death.
