Did you ever wonder where the term &#8220;milestone&#8221; came from ? As in, &#8220;I&#8217;ve reached an important milestone today.&#8221; A synonym today would be &#8220;sign&#8221; or &#8220;mile marker&#8221; and the modern-day version is likely to be green with white, plastic lettering. The photo shown here illustrates an historic version of a road sign. [<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-26" title="milemarker_l52" src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/milemarker_l52.jpg" alt="" width="84" height="270" />][1]Today the marker lies behind the Amherst County Museum & Historical Society, but it is no longer in situ. The date of this marker is uncertain but the number, most likely, corresponds to a mile along an historic turnpike. If it&#8217;s a local marker, the &#8220;L&#8221; might stand for &#8220;Lynchburg.&#8221;

During James Monroe&#8217;s Presidency (1817-1825), the first interstate roadways were created. As coaches and horseback riders traveled further away from home on federal roadways these mileage markers or milestones became increasingly important. Note, &#8220;boundary stones&#8221; were also erected during this time period. For example, the District of Columbia was surrounded by 40 such stones, shaped like diamonds, and placed a mile apart.
