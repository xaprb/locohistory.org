In honor of the upcoming holiday, I searched Albemarle County maps for roads named after the genus _Meleagris,_ order _Galliformes,_ i.e. "Turkey." [](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=172)Moving to Mechum&#8217;s River, we find the non-domestic variant, _M. gallopavo,_ at **Wild Turkey Lane**. But the most interesting setting was **Turkey Ridge Road** in the "Peacock Hill" neighborhood. Here we find an Acorn Lane, adjacent to the appropriately named "Shady Lane" and "Big Oak Road." Down the road we find other fowl species at "Peacock Drive" and "Heron Lane," with a partial bird at "Gooseneck Lane." The edge of the neighborhood contains "Apple Lane" and the inexplicable "Zump Lane." Itemize the road names near your house and see if you come up with a scene from the past, real or imagined._
