In honor of the upcoming holiday, I searched Albemarle County maps for roads named after the genus _Meleagris,_ order _Galliformes,_ i.e. &#8220;Turkey.&#8221; [](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=172)Moving to Mechum&#8217;s River, we find the non-domestic variant, _M. gallopavo,_ at **Wild Turkey Lane**. But the most interesting setting was **Turkey Ridge Road** in the &#8220;Peacock Hill&#8221; neighborhood. Here we find an Acorn Lane, adjacent to the appropriately named &#8220;Shady Lane&#8221; and &#8220;Big Oak Road.&#8221; Down the road we find other fowl species at &#8220;Peacock Drive&#8221; and &#8220;Heron Lane,&#8221; with a partial bird at &#8220;Gooseneck Lane.&#8221; The edge of the neighborhood contains &#8220;Apple Lane&#8221; and the inexplicable &#8220;Zump Lane.&#8221; Itemize the road names near your house and see if you come up with a scene from the past, real or imagined._
