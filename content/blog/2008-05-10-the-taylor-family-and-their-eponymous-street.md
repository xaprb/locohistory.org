Much of local history lies in front of our eyes, but goes unnoticed. This is not the case with the Taylor Family. <a HREF="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/05/10/the-taylor-family-and-their-eponymous-street/205/" REL="attachment wp-att-205" TITLE="taylorsthistplaque.jpg"><img SRC="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/taylorsthistplaque.jpg" ALT="taylorsthistplaque.jpg" /></a> The Martha Jefferson Neighborhood Association and Hospital combined to sponsor a marker that commemorates an African American family that has lived in the neighborhood for over 150 years. Quoting from the marker, &#8220;The land was originally part of a 25 acre parcel purchased in 1869 by Fairfax Taylor (1816-895). A former slave who bought his freedom and was the first black land owner in this area. Another member of the family, James T.S. Taylor (1840-1918) was active in politics and a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1867. Both were prominent members of the First Baptist Church and the community. As of this date [1993], their descendants live on family land in one of the three original Taylor houses.&#8221; <a HREF="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/05/10/the-taylor-family-and-their-eponymous-street/206/" REL="attachment wp-att-206" TITLE="taylorhome_503.jpg"><img SRC="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/taylorhome_503.jpg" ALT="taylorhome_503.jpg" /></a> The photo below illustrates one of the original Taylor homes. Unfortunately, the street is no longer called &#8220;Taylor.&#8221; Instead, the marker lies along Lexington avenue, just north of the Maplewood Cemetery.<font style="position: absolute;overflow: hidden;height: 0;width: 0"><br /> taking old viagra [Buy VPXL Online](http://medlab.org/buy-penis-growth-oil.html)<br /> differences between viagra and levitra<br /> </font>
