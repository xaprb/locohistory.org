If you look carefully, you will notice that downtown historic structures occasionally have a metal plaque next to the door. [](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=116) And then keep your eyes peeled when you're walking downtown. They are rare, but several buildings have these marks&#8230;.can anyone find the one below ? Hint: the color surrounding the plaque is from the color of the front porch of the house. Although it won't help you find it, the image identifies the mark as belonging to the Firemen's Insurance Company, Baltimore, Maryland. This particular policy was issued c. 1835 and contains a wonderful drawing of an old-fashioned water pump.
