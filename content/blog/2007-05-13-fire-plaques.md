If you look carefully, you will notice that downtown historic structures occasionally have a metal plaque next to the door. [](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=116) And then keep your eyes peeled when you&#8217;re walking downtown. They are rare, but several buildings have these marks&#8230;.can anyone find the one below ? Hint: the color surrounding the plaque is from the color of the front porch of the house. Although it won&#8217;t help you find it, the image identifies the mark as belonging to the Firemen&#8217;s Insurance Company, Baltimore, Maryland. This particular policy was issued c. 1835 and contains a wonderful drawing of an old-fashioned water pump.
