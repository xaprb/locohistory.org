As a tribute to the current &#8220;[](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/business/27bees.html?ex=1330232400&en=3aaa0148837b8977&ei=5088)I thought I would add a note about 19th Century bees in Albemarle County. An 1888 handbook, published to encourage &#8220;industrious farmers&#8221; to settle here, contains a chapter on &#8220;bees and honey&#8221; (pp. 48-51). William Dinwiddie&#8217;s summary describes &#8220;improved smokers,&#8221; &#8220;movable combs,&#8221; and &#8220;Italian queen bees.&#8221; He encourages everyone to get involved in beekeeping to discover the &#8220;delightful and profitable employment in it.&#8221; Moreover, he found it strange &#8220;that everyone who has a home in a region productive of honey, should not engage in its production; at least so far as to secure for his own table an abundance of this &#8211; nature&#8217;s own most delicious sweet.&#8221; So consider bee-keeping as a possible hobby this summer.
