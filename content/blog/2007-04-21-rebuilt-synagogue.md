The [Beth Israel congregation](http://www.cbicville.org/) originally worshipped
at the corner of Market and 2nd Street. In 1904, the government purchased the
site from the congregation in order to make way for a post office. The old
building materials were donated to the congregation and these materials were
used to build a new structure at the corner of 3rd and Jefferson St. This
building, in turn, burned in 1948, and the current building was rebuilt on the
site. To learn more about the history of the Beth Israel Congregation, visit the
on-line exhibit titled “[To Seek the Peace of the City: Jewish Life in
Charlottesville.”](http://www.lib.virginia.edu/small/exhibits/seek/) The
interior of the synagogue contains an unusual series of windows that document
the [Biblical story of creation through stained
glass](http://www.cbicville.org/about/windows.html).
