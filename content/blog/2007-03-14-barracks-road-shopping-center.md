The <a href="http://www.barracksroad.com/ourcommunity.php" target="_blank">Barracks Road Shopping Center</a> is one of the oldest in the country, dating to 1959. To view the rest of this great old photograph of Barracks Road, see Cville Dave&#8217;s Posting on the [Barracks Road Shopping Center in the 1960s.][1] <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=73" rel="attachment wp-att-73" title="Barracks Road, circa 1960s"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/barracks1960s.jpg" alt="Barracks Road, circa 1960s" /></a>In the photo you can see the newly built shopping center, mostly surrounded by woods, with large expanses of asphalt for the &#8220;acres of free parking&#8221; that was touted in the original advertisement. Built by an area developer, Rinehart, it displaced a famous tavern called Carroll&#8217;s Tea Room. Moore&#8217;s history of Charlottesville reports that although it often possessed neither tea nor room, it was &#8220;an oasis for thousands of thirsty university students.&#8221; <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=72" rel="attachment wp-att-72" title="Barracks Road Logo"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/barrackslogo.jpg" alt="Barracks Road Logo" /></a> If you look closely at the Barracks Road logo, found on signs along the edges of the retail center, you will notice a rider on a horse. This logo references the cavalry soldiers who manned the &#8220;Barracks.&#8221; The military barracks were constructed west of town near Ivy Farms during the Revolutionary War to house British and German prisoners-of-war.  <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=72" rel="attachment wp-att-72" title="Barracks Road Logo"></a>
