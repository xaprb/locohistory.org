The [Barracks Road Shopping Center](http://www.barracksroad.com/ourcommunity.php) is one of the oldest in the country, dating to 1959.

To view the rest of this great old photograph of Barracks Road, see [Cville Dave’s Posting on the Barracks Road Shopping Center](http://cvilledave.blogspot.com/2007/01/barracks-road-shopping-center-early.html) in the 1960s.

In the photo you can see the newly built shopping center, mostly surrounded by
woods, with large expanses of asphalt for the “acres of free parking” that was
touted in the original advertisement. Built by an area developer, Rinehart, it
displaced a famous tavern called Carroll’s Tea Room. Moore’s history of
Charlottesville reports that although it often possessed neither tea nor room,
it was “an oasis for thousands of thirsty university students.”

If you look closely at the Barracks Road logo, found on signs along the
edges of the retail center, you will notice a rider on a horse. This logo
references the cavalry soldiers who manned the “Barracks.” The military barracks
were constructed west of town near Ivy Farms during the Revolutionary War to
house British and German prisoners-of-war.
