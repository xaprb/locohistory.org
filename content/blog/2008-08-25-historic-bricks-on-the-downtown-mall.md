In this post my mission is different: to encourage you to look down at the architecturally designed roadway and its bricks. The architect is [](http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Lawrence_Halprin.html)

To listen to a podcast of public comment on the plan for the new bricks, visit the [Charlottesville Tomorrow Website](http://cvilletomorrow.typepad.com/charlottesville_tomorrow_/2008/07/downtown_mall.html). There has been a lot of public input into the use of 7.5 million dollars to refurbish the bricks and if the money is to be spent, how to produce an aesthetically pleasing result on time and on budget.

But here at locohistory we wanted to take a different approach and see just how well you know your downtown mall. [](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/2008/08/25/historic-bricks-on-the-downtown-mall/231/)
