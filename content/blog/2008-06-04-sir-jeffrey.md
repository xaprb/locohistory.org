The area now called &#8220;Amherst County&#8221; was Monacan land for 1000s of years before the first Europeans arrived. [here](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/?attachment_id=7). The county of Amherst was formed in 1761 when it was separated from Albemarle County. In 1806, Nelson County was created, leaving Amherst with its modern-day boundaries.
