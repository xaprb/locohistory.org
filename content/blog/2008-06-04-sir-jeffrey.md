The area now called &#8220;Amherst County&#8221; was Monacan land for 1000s of years before the first Europeans arrived. <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/?attachment_id=7" rel="attachment wp-att-7" title="Sir Jeffrey Amherst, painted by Joshua Reynolds in 1765."><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/sirjamherst.jpg" alt="Sir Jeffrey Amherst, painted by Joshua Reynolds in 1765." /></a> Once the Europeans arrived on the scene they had a tendency to name every feature and land mass in sight. In the case of the county, it was named after Sir Jeffrey Amherst (1717-1797), a British Baron who was eventually promoted to Field Marshal after his service in the Seven Years&#8217; War. The North American campaign, called the French and Indian Wars (1754-63), pitted the British against French forces and their Native American allies. Amherst fought most of these battles on Canadian soil, leading to the moniker &#8220;Conquerer of Canada.&#8221; While Amherst achieved many victories, he did so at a great cost. In a letter dated 16 July 1763 then General Amherst approved a suggestion to distribute blankets to &#8220;inoculate the Indians&#8221; with smallpox from gifts of contaminated blankets (the idea was suggested by Gen Bouquet in a letter dated 13 July 1763). Gen Amherst went further and suggested that he &#8220;&#8230; try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race&#8221; (Source [Peter d&#8217;Errico][1] and the website link is <a href="http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/amherst/lord_jeff.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The county of Amherst was formed in 1761 when it was separated from Albemarle County. In 1806, Nelson County was created, leaving Amherst with its modern-day boundaries.
