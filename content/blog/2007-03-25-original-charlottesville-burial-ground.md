Prior to the 20th Century, there were three public cemeteries in Charlottesville: Maplewood (founded c. 1827), Oakwood (founded c. 1860), and Riverview (founded in 1887). <a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=86" rel="attachment wp-att-86" title="graveyard_original.jpg"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/graveyard_original.jpg" alt="graveyard_original.jpg" /></a>An earlier graveyard pre-dates these, but its location is lost to the shadows of history. A rare reference to it is found in Moore&#8217;s _Albemarle: Jefferson&#8217;s County_ (1976) who mentioned a burial ground &#8220;in a garden&#8221; off Park Street, near the <a href="http://www.fpchurch.com/" target="_blank">First Presbyterian Churc</a>h. Today it is an empty lot along an otherwise densely packed street.
