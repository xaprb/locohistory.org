Prior to the 20th Century, there were three public cemeteries in
Charlottesville: Maplewood (founded c. 1827), Oakwood (founded c. 1860), and
Riverview (founded in 1887).

An earlier graveyard pre-dates these, but its location is lost to the shadows of
history. A rare reference to it is found in Moore’s Albemarle: Jefferson’s
County (1976) who mentioned a burial ground “in a garden” off Park Street, near
the [First Presbyterian Church](http://www.fpchurch.com/). Today it is an empty
lot along an otherwise densely packed street.
