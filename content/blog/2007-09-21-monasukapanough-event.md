The first [efforts are on-going to try to reconstruct a Monacan site](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/2007/02/07/monasukapanough/).

For a very informative and detailed website that discusses archaeological, historical, topographical, and ethnographic evidence for Monacan Heritage in the Piedmont, please visit the Virginia Center for Digital History's project site called "[Disappearing Indians ? A Case for the Continued Inhabitance of the Virginia Piedmont by the Monacan Indians."](http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/lewisandclark/students/projects/monacans/index.html)
