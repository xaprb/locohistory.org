[Virginia Foundation for the Humanities](http://www.locohistory.org/blog/albemarle/?attachment_id=186) and Rose and Robert Capon, the admission fee is only $4. And don&#8217;t miss the historic carousel outside the museum. The exhibition was developed by the [Virginia Museum of Natural History][2] in Martinsville. P.S. If you&#8217;re over 4 feet high, but the only thing you were taught about Indians involves "massacres," "princesses and dramatic rescues," or mascots for sports teams, this exhibit is well worth a visit.

To learn more about Virginia Indian families at the turn of the last century, visit the 3rd floor of Newcomb Hall (just east of UVa&#8217;s Emmett Street parking garage, on UVA grounds) to view a photographic exihibit (or [click here][3] for the website).
