Due to the wonderful comments in the earlier post, I decided to add a little more information about the Marchant Building off the corner of Dale Avenue & Harris (visible from Preston Avenue). The Sanborn excerpt below is thanks to the contribution of Bill Emory (read his original comment in the earlier post).

<a href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/?attachment_id=84" rel="attachment wp-att-84" title="Marchant Sanborn Map"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/marchantsanborn.jpg" alt="Marchant Sanborn Map" /></a>
  
I edited the description within the building because it would not be visible at the scale necessary to fit in this post. Because Sanborn&#8217;s were made by a fire insurance company, they list details on construction and assets within structures. The main room in the Marchant building was described as a &#8220;pressing and stock room&#8221; on the 1st floor and a &#8220;cutting and sewing&#8221; room on the 2nd. And in this map the company is described as the H.C. Marchant Manufacturing Co., Inc., manufacturers of overalls and clothing. For a detailed description of the attendant Woolen Mills neighborhood, visit the <a href="http://www.historicwoolenmills.org/" target="_blank">Historic Woolen Mills site</a> compiled by Bill Emory and his neighbors.
