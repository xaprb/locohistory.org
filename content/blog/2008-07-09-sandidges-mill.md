This week's historic feature is the 1810s [corrected date, see comment below] Sandidges Mill, located in the eponymous town (west of Amherst, off Route 60). This small community once had a church, post office, and store. <a  rel="attachment wp-att-14" href="/?attachment_id=14"><img src="/media/2008/07/sandidge3.jpg" alt="An Old Advertisement for their Services (photo by Kelly Murphy and Jami Kontkanen)" /></a>Today the building lies in ruins, but you can still read the advertisement for "feed" and "flour" if you look carefully.
