Many of these buildings point to a by-gone lifestyle. A perfect example is a mill. Once a necessity (for sawing lumber or processing grains), these businesses (and ruins thereof) were usually surrounded by a small community because it became an important location for trade, exchange, and the processing of goods.

This week&#8217;s historic feature is the 1810s [corrected date, see comment below] Sandidges Mill, located in the eponymous town (west of Amherst, off Route 60). This small community once had a church, post office, and store. <a title="An Old Advertisement for their Services (photo by Kelly Murphy and Jami Kontkanen)" rel="attachment wp-att-14" href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/?attachment_id=14"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sandidge3.jpg" alt="An Old Advertisement for their Services (photo by Kelly Murphy and Jami Kontkanen)" /></a>Today the building lies in ruins, but you can still read the advertisement for &#8220;feed&#8221; and &#8220;flour&#8221; if you look carefully. They ground corn and flour for local farmers.

The photo below shows a mill race that once brought water to power the mill. <a title="Mill Race at Sandidgesâ€™ Mill (photo by Kelly Murphy and Jami Kontkanen)" rel="attachment wp-att-13" href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/?attachment_id=13"><img src="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sandidge2.jpg" alt="Mill Race at Sandidgesâ€™ Mill (photo by Kelly Murphy and Jami Kontkanen)" /></a> The mill closed in 1942 and the usable equipment was taken to Brightwell&#8217;s Mill. If you visit the <a href="http://members.aol.com/achmuseum/muse/museoct05.html" target="_blank">Amherst County Museum & Historical Society</a> you can view an old pamphlet that illustrates milling equipment from Sandidges Mill. <a title="A ruined mill race (photo by Kelly Murphy and Jami Kontkanen)" rel="attachment wp-att-11" href="http://www.locohistory.org/blog/amherst/?attachment_id=11"></a>
